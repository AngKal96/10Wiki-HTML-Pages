                <p> <b>George Henry Daniels</b> (December 1, 1842 â€“ July 1, 1908) was an American publicist mostly known
                    for his association with the New York Central railroad lines. He published time tables and magazines
                    for the railroad. His Four Track News was a well-known travel magazine that had articles on travel,
                    biography, geography, and literature. He conceived and named the Empire State Express, onetime
                    flagship train for the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad. He also conceived the 20th Century
                    Limited luxury train. Celebrities and famous people rode this train. And it became the setting for
                    an eponymous-named Broadway play and Hollywood movie. He is the one that conceived the red cap
                    railroad porter service and the red carpet service, a new term in the American culture known as the
                    "red carpet treatment".

                    Daniels was born on December 1, 1842.[1] He went to the public schools of Hampshire, Illinois and
                    while growing up spent most of his time on a local farm. He got his first job in 1857 when he was 15
                    years old as an assistant rodman in the engineer corps on the construction of the Northern Missouri
                    Railroad.[2] He was promoted to various duties of higher responsibility in practical railroad work
                    through the years.[1][3]

                    Daniels at the age of thirty in 1872 was laid off from the Northern Missouri Railroad due to bad
                    economic times when the railroad fell into financial difficulty. He got a job then at the Chicago &
                    Pacific Railroad as a freight and passenger manager working out of Chicago.[2] Daniels meanwhile had
                    contributed news of local interest to a newspaper publisher in Chicago between 1857 and 1872. He was
                    writing while employed with the Chicago & Pacific railroad and promoted the company. He wrote up in
                    1873 a factual archival record of the railroad company activity and worked eight years at the
                    railroad before returning to the Northern Missouri Railroad, which had been taken over by the
                    Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific railroad.[4] He became a general ticket agent for the Wabash system
                    from 1880 to 1882.[1]<br><br>
                    Daniels later then for the first ten months of 1882 held a position as the commissioner of the Iowa
                    Trunk-Line Association.[1] In November 1882 he was elected commissioner of the Colorado Traffic
                    Association.[3] He was also manager of the Utah Traffic League when Utah was still a territory. By
                    1886 he had become the official director of the Central Passenger Board. Later it was named the
                    Central Traffic Association and he was elected vice-chairman of the organization.[1] In time he was
                    promoted to the main director of the Chicago East-bound Passenger Board and that group was of
                    interest to the New York Central railroad lines. The railroad observed Daniels' work and offered him
                    an assignment as manager of the General Passenger Agency headquartered at Grand Central Station in
                    New York City and he accepted the position.[3] He was general passenger agent from 1889 to
                    1907.[5]<br><br>
                    Daniels commanded both the railroads of the New York Central lines and the broadcasting of railroad
                    news stories being put in charge of their advertising bureau.[1] He was not only their general
                    passenger agent but also its prophet.[6] He delivered prunes and apples transporting them by
                    shipment to the east coast of the United States by the Southern Pacific railroad. He had them
                    provided in all railroad dining cars and promoted their excellence in the newspapers.[4] He also had
                    mail that came from Australia and bound for London promoted as a technological achievement. He
                    published in newspapers how mail from Australia that had traveled by steamship to the United States
                    was carried by railroads to the eastern region of the United States and from there sent by boat to
                    its end destination in London and it only took 32 days. With his publicity he showed the world the
                    technology of steam trains in the United States and the products of American resourcefulness and
                    inventiveness.[4]

                    Daniels made railroad timetables that were published for the New York Central and his name was
                    usually on them. He published a travel magazine from Grand Central Station that was called the
                    Four-Track News.[7] The magazine had articles on travel, biography, and literature. New York
                    Central's label given to it in the early 1900s was the "Four Track System". Daniels coined this term
                    highlighting the company's history as being the world's first railroad to have four parallel
                    tracks.[1][8] The magazine was published in the Transit Building at 7 East 42nd Street after
                    1903.[9]The yearly subscription in 1905 was one dollar (equivalent to $30 in 2021). The magazine
                    advertised in other publications and said that in every one of its issues there were more than
                    twenty articles and 100 illustrations and produced about 1,500 pictures in a year. It claimed that
                    it had quality articles on history and geography that would be a good supplement to school
                    lessons.[10] The magazine continued to be published in some form or adaptation until 2003 under
                    Travel and Travel Holiday.[4][8]<br><br>
                    Daniels in 1890 contrived the title "Empire State Express", which was New York Central's newest
                    train at the time that ultimately became the fastest regularly scheduled passenger train in
                    America.[8] He was assigned to promote the train, which made a journey from New York City to the
                    town of Buffalo in under six hours. Daniels suggested the idea of making an exceptionally fast
                    locomotive to pull the five car train, which was done under the direction of locomotive designer
                    William Buchanan.[11] That train engine had the number 999 and ran a speed test of 112.5 miles per
                    hour (181.1 km/h).[12][11] The speed event was specifically designed to get people's attention on
                    the railroad's capability to get them to The 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where the locomotive was
                    exhibited to the public. Daniels even influenced the United States Postmaster General to put out a
                    commemorative stamp featuring locomotive 999 and the Empire State Express.[5][8] Being issued in
                    1901, it was one of the first stamps available in the 20th century.[4]

                    A noteworthy achievement credited to Daniels was his conception in 1902 of a luxury train traveling
                    in record time between New York and Chicago.[13] He christened it the 20th Century Limited and
                    fought for launching the development of the state-of-the-art New York Central train.[14][5] The
                    Limited was inaugurated between New York and Chicago on June 15 in 1902 as the train ahead of its
                    time by a hundred years.[5] The 20th Century Limited concept of a faster than normal train that was
                    also a luxury train was an offshoot of the Empire State Express train that Daniels played a role in
                    developing through his creative efforts.[15]<br><br>
                    Daniels promoted the New York Central flagship train as the greatest train in the world. It
                    reflected the hope that it could be the originator and pioneer of a new era in high-speed rail
                    transportation. He publicized famous passengers that rode it on a regular bases including the
                    Vanderbilts, Whitneys, and Mellons.[16] It became synonymous with lavish railway excursions.[17][18]
                    Daniels coined the name 20th Century Limited and it symbolized speed and style.[14] Some took
                    Daniels's inspired train from New York City to Albany back and forth routinely for a scenic
                    excursion, forming a travel club and calling themselves Twentieth Century Limited
                    Associates.[16]<br><br>
                    Daniels initiated a 20-hour New York-Chicago schedule which many times attracted a larger than
                    normal amount of passengers and required adding additional passenger cars to serve these additional
                    riders.[19] He conceived the idea of publishing free travel brochures about the New York Central
                    lines of where they went, one titled Health and Pleasure on America's Greatest Railroad.[20] He
                    introduced teams of red-cap railroad porter service assistants in 1896 that came from the New York
                    Central lines.[18][20] Daniels also introduced a red carpet service that the 20th Century Limited
                    railroad rolled out along the platform for the boarding passengers in New York City and
                    Chicago.[19][21] This resulted in a new term for the American culture known as the "red carpet
                    treatment".[16][22] He was called the "Father of the Century" since he brought to fruition through
                    his efforts of publicity ingenuity and leadership of the advertisement for the New York Central
                    lines, especially the 20th Century Limited and its elegant luxury service.[5][23]

                    Public Transportation Association and was one of its directors; and he was prominent in The

                    Daniels in 1905 left his position as New York Central's General Passenger Agent.[24] He then took a
                    position as director of their new advertising department.[24] He occupied that position until 1907
                    and then retired permanently.[24] He remained with the company in an advisory capacity.[24] Daniels
                    lived his final year of life split between Lake Placid and Buffalo. He died in Lake Placid at the
                    age of 66 on July 1, 1908.[3][4]

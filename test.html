                    The <b>Battle of St. Charles</b> was fought on June 17, 1862, at St. Charles, Arkansas, during the
                    American Civil War. Earlier in 1862, a Union Army force commanded by Major General Samuel R. Curtis
                    moved against Little Rock, Arkansas, but became bogged down in the Batesville area due to lack of
                    supplies. The Union
                    leadership decided to send a naval force from Memphis, Tennessee, up the White River to resupply
                    Curtis's men.
                    Major General Thomas C. Hindman, the Confederate commander in Arkansas, had fortifications
                    constructed
                    near St.
                    Charles to stop the Union movement. Two artillery positions were built, and three ships, including
                    CSS
                    Maurepas, were
                    scuttled to obstruct the river.<br><br>The Union ships advanced against the Confederate positions on
                    June 17. The 46th Indiana Infantry Regiment was sent ashore to attack the fortifications on land,
                    while
                    two ironclads and two timberclads
                    attacked the fort from the river. During the fighting, a Confederate solid shot struck the ironclad
                    USS
                    Mound City,
                    puncturing one of the ship's steam drums. In what has been referred to as the deadliest shot of the
                    war,
                    scalding
                    steam filled the ship, killing or wounding all but about 25 of the roughly 175 men on the vessel.
                    The
                    46th
                    Indiana overran the Confederate defenses on land and the position was taken. The supply mission was
                    unable to
                    make it all the way to Curtis's position, and withdrew back down the river due to low water levels.
                    Thereafter,
                    Curtis's army cut loose from their supply line and marched to Helena, Arkansas. A portion of the
                    battlefield is listed
                    on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Charles Battle Site.

                  <h4 class="p-title">Early activity in Arkansas</h4>
                  <p>
                    After the election of Abraham Lincoln as
                    President of the United States in
                    1860, several southern states
                    considered seceding from the union. The southern state of Arkansas held a statewide election on
                    February
                    18, 1861, to create a convention to vote on secession, with anti-secessionist delegates initially
                    holding the majority. Slavery was considered to be a key issue. After convening on March 4 (the same
                    day
                    that Lincoln was inaugurated), the convention adjourned on March 21 without reaching a
                    conclusion.[1]
                    The bombardment of Fort Sumter by Confederate troops forcing the surrender of the United States-held
                    fort in seceded territory on April 12[2] swung political opinion to secession, and the convention
                    reconvened on May 6, voting to secede later that day. Arkansas then joined the Confederate States of
                    America.[1]<br><br>After significant military activity in Missouri throughout 1861, Major General
                    Earl
                    Van Dorn of the
                    Confederate States Army formed the Army of the West in early March 1862 from forces commanded by
                    Missouri State Guard Major General Sterling Price and Confederate Brigadier General Ben McCulloch.
                    Van
                    Dorn moved his army north towards the Union army of Major General Samuel R. Curtis, but was defeated
                    at
                    the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8.[3] After the defeat, Van Dorn moved his troops east of the
                    Mississippi River, with the movement completed by late April. During the process, Van Dorn
                    essentially
                    stripped Arkansas of its military strength and supplies, and weakened the Confederate
                    Trans-Mississippi
                    Department.[4]<br><br>Curtis fell back into Missouri after the battle, but then moved his army east
                    to
                    West Plains before
                    turning south. They re-entered Arkansas on April 29 and headed for Batesville.[5] By May 2, the
                    Union
                    soldiers had reached Batesville. A separate column commanded by Brigadier General Frederick Steele
                    reached Jacksonport, which was near Batesville and on the White River, on May 4. Curtis absorbed
                    Steele's men into his force and began to move on the state capital at Little Rock.[6] The movement
                    caused the Confederate government of Arkansas to retire to Hot Springs,[7] and Curtis's men crossed
                    the
                    White River near Batesville.[6] On May 19, a small Union force crossed the Little Red River to
                    forage,
                    but was attacked by Confederate cavalry near Searcy; some of the Union soldiers, including wounded
                    men,
                    were murdered while attempting to surrender.[8] Curtis was informed the next day that his line of
                    supply
                    was at the breaking point, and he decided that further advance without a new supply line was
                    untenable.
                    A small offensive across the Little Red on May 27 was successful,[8] but lack of supplies forced
                    Curtis
                    to withdraw back across both the Little Red and the White, and he sent a message to the Union
                    leadership
                    in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 4, that he would need to continue his retreat if not
                    reinforced.[9]<br><br>The message was forwarded to Major General Henry W. Halleck, who then directed
                    Flag Officer Charles H. Davis to send a flotilla up the White River to Jacksonport to resupply
                    Curtis,
                    as the roads in that region of Arkansas were too poor for easy resupply by land.[10] Halleck also
                    communicated with United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who in turn passed the
                    communication
                    to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, who sent a telegram to Davis ordering him to move up the
                    White
                    to relieve Curtis. Davis received Welles's telegram on June 12 and began making immediate
                    preparations
                    for the movement. He asked Colonel Charles R. Ellet, commander of the Ram Fleet, to send some of the
                    ram
                    ships to serve with the vessels of Davis's Western Flotilla, but Ellet would agree to this only
                    under
                    the condition that the Ram Fleet and Western Flotilla vessels would be separate commands, which
                    Davis
                    refused.[11] Less than a week before, on June 6, the Ram Fleet, under Ellet's father Charles Ellet
                    Jr.,
                    and Davis's flotilla, had defeated a Confederate naval fleet at the First Battle of Memphis and
                    taken
                    the city of Memphis, Tennessee.[12] The furthest north Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi
                    River
                    was now Vicksburg, Mississippi, as positions upriver at Columbus, Kentucky, and Island Number Ten
                    had
                    been taken earlier in the year. Few Confederate gunboats remained on the upper portion of the
                    Mississippi watershed, and they were generally in hiding.[13]

              <h2 class="section-title">Attack</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>
                The attack took place at the St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in the Owo local government area and
                began at around 11:30 AM (GMT+1) as worshippers inside the church were attending Mass and
                celebrating Pentecost.[3][5] A group of gunmen entered the church disguised as congregants, carrying
                bags that contained firearms. Another group took positions outside the church. Improvised explosive
                devices were detonated outside the church and both groups began firing on worshippers.[5] Those
                outside the church shot directly into it while those disguised as congregants fired from inside,
                shooting a boy who was selling candy at the entrance[6][7] and worshippers trying to reach two open
                sets of doors. The main entrance was locked[8] and the gunmen inside shot at anyone who moved.
                Passersby also were struck by bullets.[9] Videos of the inside of the church showed bodies of
                victims lying in pools of blood across the floor.[4][10] After the attack the gunmen fled using a
                stolen Nissan Sunny.[5]<br><br>
                A priest who survived the massacre said that the attack took place when the church "[was] about to
                round off service. I had even asked people to start leaving, that was how we started hearing
                gunshots from different angles. We hid inside the church but some people had left when the attack
                happened. We locked ourselves in the church for 20 minutes. When we heard that they had left, we
                opened the church and rushed victims to the hospital."[11] Another priest who had temporarily left
                the building prior to the attack said he was walking back to the church when survivors running
                outside stopped him and told him that a massacre was taking place inside.[12]<br><br>
                A witness said that he saw five gunmen who perpetrated the attack.[13] Two security forces officers
                were also killed.[14] After significant military activity in Missouri throughout 1861, Major General EarlVan Dorn of the
                Confederate States Army formed the Army of the West in early March 1862 from forces commanded by
                Missouri State Guard Major General Sterling Price and Confederate Brigadier General Ben McCulloch.
                Van
                Dorn moved his army north towards the Union army of Major General Samuel R. Curtis, but was defeated
                at
                the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8.[3] After the defeat, Van Dorn moved his troops east of the
                Mississippi River, with the movement completed by late April. During the process, Van Dorn
                essentially
                stripped Arkansas of its military strength and supplies, and weakened the Confederate
                Trans-Mississippi
                Department.[4]<br><br>Curtis fell back into Missouri after the battle, but then moved his army east
                to
                West Plains before
                turning south. They re-entered Arkansas on April 29 and headed for Batesville.[5] By May 2, the
                Union
                soldiers had reached Batesville. A separate column commanded by Brigadier General Frederick Steele
                reached Jacksonport, which was near Batesville and on the White River, on May 4. Curtis absorbed
                Steele's men into his force and began to move on the state capital at Little Rock.[6] The movement
                caused the Confederate government of Arkansas to retire to Hot Springs,[7] and Curtis's men crossed
                the
                White River near Batesville.[6] On May 19, a small Union force crossed the Little Red River to
                forage,
                but was attacked by Confederate cavalry near Searcy; some of the Union soldiers, including wounded
                men,
                were murdered while attempting to surrender.[8] Curtis was informed the next day that his line of
                supply
                was at the breaking point, and he decided that further advance without a new supply line was
                untenable.
                A small offensive across the Little Red on May 27 was successful,[8] but lack of supplies forced
                Curtis
                to withdraw back across both the Little Red and the White, and he sent a message to the Union
                leadership
                in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 4, that he would need to continue his retreat if not
                reinforced.[9]<br><br>The message was forwarded to Major General Henry W. Halleck, who then directed
                Flag Officer Charles H. Davis to send a flotilla up the White River to Jacksonport to resupply
                Curtis,
                as the roads in that region of Arkansas were too poor for easy resupply by land.[10] Halleck also
                communicated with United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who in turn passed the
                communication
                to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, who sent a telegram to Davis ordering him to move up the
                White
                to relieve Curtis. Davis received Welles's telegram on June 12 and began making immediate
                preparations
                for the movement. He asked Colonel Charles R. Ellet, commander of the Ram Fleet, to send some of the
                ram
                ships to serve with the vessels of Davis's Western Flotilla, but Ellet would agree to this only
                under
                the condition that the Ram Fleet and Western Flotilla vessels would be separate commands, which
                Davis
                refused.[11] Less than a week before, on June 6, the Ram Fleet, under Ellet's father Charles Ellet
                Jr.,
                and Davis's flotilla, had defeated a Confederate naval fleet at the First Battle of Memphis and
                taken
                the city of Memphis, Tennessee.[12] The furthest north Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi
                River
                was now Vicksburg, Mississippi, as positions upriver at Columbus, Kentucky, and Island Number Ten
                had
                been taken earlier in the year. Few Confederate gunboats remained on the upper portion of the
                Mississippi watershed, and they were generally in hiding.[13]

              <h2 class="section-title">Casualties</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>
                The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said on 7 June that at least 22 dead bodies from the
                attack were in the local hospital's morgue, including two children,[15] and that at least 58 had
                been injured.[16][17] Many of the dead bodies at the church had been taken by their family members
                to a private burial at home, indicating a higher death toll.[15][a] On 9 June the government revised
                its death toll to at least 40, saying that 61 injured survivors were still in the hospital.[17][19]
                At least five children are confirmed to have been killed.[20]<br><br>
                Witnesses and media agencies placed the number of people killed at over 50. Local politician
                Adelegbe Timileyin said there were over 50 fatalities including children, while other sources
                estimated a higher death count.[3][21] A doctor said that at least 50 bodies had been
                recovered.[22][23] Timileyin also said that the priest had been abducted, which the Roman Catholic
                Diocese of Ondo denied.[13][24] The Diocese's reverend clarified that the priest and other clergymen
                were safe.[25] Ondo State House of Assembly majority leader Oluwole Ogunmolasuyi visited the attack
                site and counted at least 20 dead, estimating the death toll at somewhere between 70 and 100.[26]
                Doctors told reporters that the attack had caused a mass-casualty incident and the local hospitals
                were overwhelmed with victims.[12] ABC News cited an unnamed source who reported there were bodies
                of 82 victims stored in a local morgue while another source briefed on the recent U.S. intelligence
                assessment estimated deaths to be above 80.[27]
              </p>
              <h2 class="section-title">Aftermath</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>
                Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, cancelled his trip in Abuja and went to the scene of the
                attack;[28] he called it "vile and satanic",[29] as well as a "black Sunday in Owo".[30] Akeredolu
                vowed to "commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay".[29]
                President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, condemned the massacre saying it was a "heinous attack on
                worshippers".[13] Pope Francis prayed for the victims who were "painfully stricken in a moment of
                celebration".[13] The rebel Indigenous People of Biafra organization, which seeks to restore the
                separatist Igbo state of Biafra, called the attack as an "unacceptable" action and an Islamic terror
                attack, asserting that "Christians should stop their dependence on government of Nigeria for
                security of life and properties... The current regime has only one interest and that is [the] Fulani
                interest." IPOB said that Biafran separatist groups should defend churches in Southern
                Nigeria.[31]<br><br>
                The massacre was received with widespread shock from the Nigerian public. The response by President
                Buhari and his All Progressives Congress party was criticized as inadequate, and Buhari sparked
                controversy after he was caught hosting a party with other APC members hours after the attack.[32]
                The Amotekun Corps announced deployment of its forces to protect churches and mosques in the state
                on 12 June.[33]<br><br>
                A state funeral for the victims was organized by Nigerian authorities on 17 June. As the funeral
                mass was held, Akeredolu promised to improve the security situation in the state and admitted that
                he bore responsibility for failing to provide security.[34][35] Bishop Jude Arogundade of the Roman
                Catholic Diocese of Ondo criticized the Buhari Administration for "empty promises" regarding
                maintaining security and preventing terrorism, telling the funeral-goers they needed to "claim this
                country back from those destroying it."[20] Bishop Emmanuel Badejo, who among the officiating clergy
                at the mass funeral, demanded that the government "wake up, sit up and act up to secure lives and
                properties all over Nigeria."[34]
              </p>
              <h2 class="section-title">Culpability</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>
                No group has yet claimed responsibility,[29] and the authorities or government officials have not
                blamed anyone; numerous Owo locals from the Yoruba ethnic group have accused members of the Hausa
                and Fulani herdsmen groups of complicity.[36] Police found three undetonated improvised explosive
                devices at the scene, as well as several shells from AK-47 ammunition.[37][38]<br><br>
                The federal government of Nigeria identified the Islamic State – West Africa Province (ISWAP) group
                as being behind the attack on 9 June. Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola stated that the security
                forces were pursuing the culprits. Local elders, including Owo's king Kabiyesi, attempted to calm
                anger among the residents after the massacre in order to prevent reprisal attacks.[39][19] Akeredolu
                however cast doubt on the federal government's declaration, stating that it was "too hasty" since
                ISWAP tended to take responsibility for its attacks.[40][41][42]

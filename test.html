                  <p><b>Duke of Wellington</b> is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The name derived from
                    Wellington in Somerset, and the title was created in 1814 for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of
                    Wellington (1769–1852; born as The Hon. Arthur Wesley), the Anglo-Irish military commander who is
                    best known for leading the decisive victory with Field Marshal von Blücher over Napoleon's forces at
                    Waterloo in Brabant (now Walloon Brabant, Belgium). Wellesley later served twice as British prime
                    minister.

                    The first Duke's father, Garret Wesley, had been granted the title of Earl of Mornington in 1760.
                    His male-line ancestors were wealthy agricultural and urban landowners in both countries, among the
                    Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy. The dukedom has descended to heirs male of the body, along with
                    eleven other hereditary titles.

                  <p>
                    The titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess Douro were bestowed upon Arthur Wellesley, 1st
                    Marquess of Wellington, on 3 May 1814 after he returned home a hero following Napoleon's
                    abdication.[2][3] He fought some sixty battles during his military career. He was considered "the
                    conqueror of Napoleon". He stands as one of the finest soldiers that Great Britain and Ireland has
                    ever produced, others being the 1st Duke of Marlborough and the 2nd Duke of Argyll.<br>
                    The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Wellington are Marquess of Wellington (1812), Marquess Douro
                    (1814), Earl of Mornington (1760 – but only inherited by the Dukes of Wellington in 1863), Earl of
                    Wellington (1812), Viscount Wellesley (1760 – inherited in 1863), Viscount Wellington (1809), Baron
                    Mornington (1746 – also inherited in 1863), and Baron Douro (1809). The Viscountcy of Wellesley and
                    the Barony and Earldom of Mornington are in the Peerage of Ireland; the rest are in the Peerage of
                    the United Kingdom.<br>
                    Apart from the British titles, the Dukes of Wellington also hold the titles of Prince of Waterloo
                    (Prins van Waterloo, 1815) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (Duque de
                    Ciudad Rodrigo, 1812) of the Kingdom of Spain, and Duke of Victoria (Duque da Vitória, 1812), with
                    the subsidiary titles Marquess of Torres Vedras (Marquês de Torres Vedras, 1812) and Count of
                    Vimeiro (Conde de Vimeiro, 1811) of the Kingdom of Portugal. These were granted to the first Duke as
                    victory titles for his distinguished service as victorious commanding general in the Peninsular War
                    (in Spain and Portugal) and at the Battle of Waterloo (in what is now Belgium).<br>
                    The family seat is Stratfield Saye House, nesar Basingstoke, Hampshire. Apsley House, in London, is
                    now owned by English Heritage, although the family retain an apartment there.<br>
                    Five Dukes have been created Knights of the Garter, the most senior British order of knighthood.

                    Should the direct male line of succession from the first Duke of Wellington become extinct, the
                    dukedom and its subsidiary titles in the British peerage will become extinct, as will the titles of
                    Prince of Waterloo in the Dutch peerage and the dukedom of the Victory and its subsidiary titles in
                    the Portuguese peerage. The dukedom of Ciudad Rodrigo in the Spanish peerage, together with its
                    subsidiary titles, will continue to be held in the female line of descendants of the first Duke. The
                    earldom and barony of Mornington, along with the viscountcy of Wellesley, which are all titles in
                    the Irish peerage, will revert to the line of the Earl Cowley, a male-line descendant of a younger
                    brother of the first Duke of Wellington.

                    The Colley or Cowley family had come to Ireland from Glaston, in Rutland about 1500; Sir Henry
                    Colley was elevated to the Peerage as Lord Glaston by Henry VIII. He married the daughter of Thomas
                    Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Catherine Wellesley Cusack (d. 1598) whose grandmother was a
                    Wellesley.[5] Upon the death of his cousin Garret Wesley and his inheritance of the Estates of
                    Dangan and Mornington, Richard Colley (d. 1758) and his wife Elizabeth Sale (d. 17 June 1738)
                    daughter of John Sale, Registrar of the Diocese of Dublin, on 23 December 1719.[6] adopted the name
                    Wellesley (from both Elizabeth's maternal family side from Catherine Wellesley Cusack her
                    grandmother) and through her Husband's Family, his cousin, Garret Wesley (Wellesley).

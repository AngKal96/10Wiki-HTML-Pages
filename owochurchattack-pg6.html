                <p> On 5 June 2022, a mass shooting and bomb attack occurred at a Catholic church in the city of Owo in
                    Ondo State, Nigeria. At least 40 people were killed. Federal authorities suspect the Islamic State –
                    West Africa Province of carrying out the massacre. Some reports estimated casualties to be 50 and up
                    to 80 or more persons.[1]

                    Ondo State is a relatively peaceful state in southwestern Nigeria. Most of the rest of the
                    country[2] suffers low-intensity conflicts, including a jihadist insurgency by Boko Haram mostly in
                    the northeast, and a conflict with bandits in the northwest, both of which have continued for more
                    than a decade. A separate low-level insurgency in the southeast led by the Indigenous People of
                    Biafra movement began in 2021. An increase in violence between farmers and nomads in Ondo had been
                    recorded prior to the massacre,[3] and the state's government had recently passed restrictions on
                    grazing.[4]

                    The attack took place at the St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in the Owo local government area and
                    began at around 11:30 AM (GMT+1) as worshippers inside the church were attending Mass and
                    celebrating Pentecost.[3][5] A group of gunmen entered the church disguised as congregants, carrying
                    bags that contained firearms. Another group took positions outside the church. Improvised explosive
                    devices were detonated outside the church and both groups began firing on worshippers.[5] Those
                    outside the church shot directly into it while those disguised as congregants fired from inside,
                    shooting a boy who was selling candy at the entrance[6][7] and worshippers trying to reach two open
                    sets of doors. The main entrance was locked[8] and the gunmen inside shot at anyone who moved.
                    Passersby also were struck by bullets.[9] Videos of the inside of the church showed bodies of
                    victims lying in pools of blood across the floor.[4][10] After the attack the gunmen fled using a
                    stolen Nissan Sunny.[5]<br><br>
                    A priest who survived the massacre said that the attack took place when the church "[was] about to
                    round off service. I had even asked people to start leaving, that was how we started hearing
                    gunshots from different angles. We hid inside the church but some people had left when the attack
                    happened. We locked ourselves in the church for 20 minutes. When we heard that they had left, we
                    opened the church and rushed victims to the hospital."[11] Another priest who had temporarily left
                    the building prior to the attack said he was walking back to the church when survivors running
                    outside stopped him and told him that a massacre was taking place inside.[12]<br><br>
                    A witness said that he saw five gunmen who perpetrated the attack.[13] Two security forces officers
                    were also killed.[14]

                <p>
                    The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said on 7 June that at least 22 dead bodies from the
                    attack were in the local hospital's morgue, including two children,[15] and that at least 58 had
                    been injured.[16][17] Many of the dead bodies at the church had been taken by their family members
                    to a private burial at home, indicating a higher death toll.[15][a] On 9 June the government revised
                    its death toll to at least 40, saying that 61 injured survivors were still in the hospital.[17][19]
                    At least five children are confirmed to have been killed.[20]<br><br>
                    Witnesses and media agencies placed the number of people killed at over 50. Local politician
                    Adelegbe Timileyin said there were over 50 fatalities including children, while other sources
                    estimated a higher death count.[3][21] A doctor said that at least 50 bodies had been
                    recovered.[22][23] Timileyin also said that the priest had been abducted, which the Roman Catholic
                    Diocese of Ondo denied.[13][24] The Diocese's reverend clarified that the priest and other clergymen
                    were safe.[25] Ondo State House of Assembly majority leader Oluwole Ogunmolasuyi visited the attack
                    site and counted at least 20 dead, estimating the death toll at somewhere between 70 and 100.[26]
                    Doctors told reporters that the attack had caused a mass-casualty incident and the local hospitals
                    were overwhelmed with victims.[12] ABC News cited an unnamed source who reported there were bodies
                    of 82 victims stored in a local morgue while another source briefed on the recent U.S. intelligence
                    assessment estimated deaths to be above 80.[27]

                    Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, cancelled his trip in Abuja and went to the scene of the
                    attack;[28] he called it "vile and satanic",[29] as well as a "black Sunday in Owo".[30] Akeredolu
                    vowed to "commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay".[29]
                    President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, condemned the massacre saying it was a "heinous attack on
                    worshippers".[13] Pope Francis prayed for the victims who were "painfully stricken in a moment of
                    celebration".[13] The rebel Indigenous People of Biafra organization, which seeks to restore the
                    separatist Igbo state of Biafra, called the attack as an "unacceptable" action and an Islamic terror
                    attack, asserting that "Christians should stop their dependence on government of Nigeria for
                    security of life and properties... The current regime has only one interest and that is [the] Fulani
                    interest." IPOB said that Biafran separatist groups should defend churches in Southern
                    Nigeria.[31]<br><br>
                    The massacre was received with widespread shock from the Nigerian public. The response by President
                    Buhari and his All Progressives Congress party was criticized as inadequate, and Buhari sparked
                    controversy after he was caught hosting a party with other APC members hours after the attack.[32]
                    The Amotekun Corps announced deployment of its forces to protect churches and mosques in the state
                    on 12 June.[33]<br><br>
                    A state funeral for the victims was organized by Nigerian authorities on 17 June. As the funeral
                    mass was held, Akeredolu promised to improve the security situation in the state and admitted that
                    he bore responsibility for failing to provide security.[34][35] Bishop Jude Arogundade of the Roman
                    Catholic Diocese of Ondo criticized the Buhari Administration for "empty promises" regarding
                    maintaining security and preventing terrorism, telling the funeral-goers they needed to "claim this
                    country back from those destroying it."[20] Bishop Emmanuel Badejo, who among the officiating clergy
                    at the mass funeral, demanded that the government "wake up, sit up and act up to secure lives and
                    properties all over Nigeria."[34]

                    No group has yet claimed responsibility,[29] and the authorities or government officials have not
                    blamed anyone; numerous Owo locals from the Yoruba ethnic group have accused members of the Hausa
                    and Fulani herdsmen groups of complicity.[36] Police found three undetonated improvised explosive
                    devices at the scene, as well as several shells from AK-47 ammunition.[37][38]<br><br>
                    The federal government of Nigeria identified the Islamic State – West Africa Province (ISWAP) group
                    as being behind the attack on 9 June. Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola stated that the security
                    forces were pursuing the culprits. Local elders, including Owo's king Kabiyesi, attempted to calm
                    anger among the residents after the massacre in order to prevent reprisal attacks.[39][19] Akeredolu
                    however cast doubt on the federal government's declaration, stating that it was "too hasty" since
                    ISWAP tended to take responsibility for its attacks.[40][41][42]

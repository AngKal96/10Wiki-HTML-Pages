                    <b>John Francis Stanley Russell, 2nd Earl Russell</b> known as <b>Frank Russell</b>(12 August 1865 –
                    3
                    March 1931), was a British nobleman, barrister and politician, the elder brother of the philosopher
                    Bertrand Russell, and the grandson of John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, who was twice prime minister
                    of
                    Britain. The elder son of Viscount and Viscountess Amberley, Russell became well-known for his
                    marital
                    woes, and was convicted of bigamy before the House of Lords in 1901, the last peer to be convicted
                    of an
                    offence in a trial by the Lords before that privilege of peerage was abolished in 1948.<br><br>
                    Russell was raised by his paternal grandparents after his unconventional parents both died young. He
                    was
                    discontented living with his grandparents, but enjoyed four happy years at Winchester College. His
                    academic education came to a sudden end when he was sent down from Balliol College, Oxford, probably
                    because authorities there had suspicions concerning the nature of his relationship with the future
                    poet
                    Lionel Johnson, and he always bitterly resented his treatment by Oxford. After spending time in the
                    United States, he married the first of his three wives, Mabel Edith Scott, in 1890. The two quickly
                    separated, and the next several years saw acrimonious litigation in the courts, but the restrictive
                    English laws of the time meant there was no divorce. Russell was elected to the London County
                    Council in
                    1895, and served there until 1904. In 1899, he accompanied the woman who would become his second
                    wife,
                    Mollie Somerville, to Nevada, where each obtained a divorce, and they married, then returned to
                    Britain
                    to live as husband and wife. Russell was the first celebrity to get a Nevada divorce, but it was not
                    recognised by English law, and in June 1901, he was arrested for bigamy. He pleaded guilty before
                    the
                    House of Lords, and served three months in Holloway, afterwards marrying Mollie according to English
                    law. He gained a free pardon for the offence in 1911.<br><br>
                    Beginning in 1902 Russell campaigned for divorce law reform, using his hereditary seat as a peer in
                    the
                    House of Lords to advocate this, but had little success. He was also a campaigner for motorists'
                    rights,
                    often taking briefs to defend them after being called to the bar in 1905, and at one time had the
                    registration number plate A 1. His second marriage ended after he fell in love with the novelist
                    Elizabeth von Arnim in 1914, and he married von Arnim in 1916. The couple soon separated, though
                    they
                    did not divorce, and Elizabeth caricatured him in her novel Vera, to his anger. Frank Russell aided
                    his
                    brother Bertrand when he was imprisoned for anti-war activities in 1918. Increasingly aligned with
                    the
                    Labour Party, Russell was given junior office in the second MacDonald government in 1929, but his
                    ministerial career was cut short by his death in 1931. Despite his achievements, Frank Russell is
                    obscure compared to his brother and grandfather, and his marital difficulties led to his being
                    dubbed
                    the "Wicked Earl".

                    John Francis Stanley Russell was born on 12 August 1865 at Alderley Park in Cheshire. He was the
                    first
                    child of John Russell, Viscount Amberley, the eldest son of John Russell, 1st Earl Russell. The earl
                    twice served as prime minister of Britain,[a] and earlier in his career, had been an architect of
                    the
                    Reform Act 1832. In 1864, Amberley married Katherine Louisa Stanley, younger daughter of Edward
                    Stanley,
                    2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley, uniting two prominent Whig families. Alderley Park was the seat of
                    the
                    Stanley family.[2][3]<br><br>
                    Unconventional for their time, the Amberleys believed in birth control, feminism, political reforms
                    then
                    considered radical (including votes for women and the working classes) and free love, and lived
                    according to their ideals.[4][5] For example, feeling it unfair that Douglas Spalding, the tutor of
                    their son Frank, should remain celibate, the viscountess invited Spalding to share her bed, with the
                    approval of her husband. The Amberleys had two children after Frank, Rachel (born 1868) and Bertrand
                    (born 1872). The family lived at Rodborough house (near Stroud), which belonged to the viscount's
                    father, and then at Ravenscroft Hall, near Trellech, where Frank was allowed to do much as he
                    pleased,
                    including roaming the countryside. His parents had lost religious faith and Frank was not called
                    upon to
                    attend church. By age eight, he had read, for pleasure, the complete works of Sir Walter Scott, and
                    began a lifelong love of science and engineering by attending the Royal Society's lectures for
                    children.[4]

                    In December 1873, the family journeyed to Italy; during the return the following May, Frank came
                    down
                    with diphtheria. He was nursed by his mother, and recovered, but in June both she and Rachel fell
                    ill
                    with the disease. The viscountess died on 28 June and her daughter five days later, dealing the
                    viscount
                    a blow from which he never really recovered. He died on 9 January 1876 from pneumonia.[6] The
                    viscount's
                    will nominated T. J. Sanderson, a friend from his university days, and Spalding as co-guardians of
                    Frank
                    and Bertrand. The earl and his wife, Frances Russell, Countess Russell (often referred to as Lady
                    John
                    Russell) might have accepted Sanderson, even though he was (like Spalding) an atheist, but Spalding
                    was
                    of a lower social class and was not acceptable, especially once they had the opportunity to read the
                    Amberleys' surviving papers and learnt the nature of his relationship with the viscountess.[7] The
                    Earl
                    Russell and Lady John brought suit in the Court of Chancery, and Sanderson and Spalding chose not to
                    fight the suit. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the custody of their paternal grandparents, with
                    two
                    of the Russells' adult children, Rollo and Agatha, also co-guardians.[8]<br><br>
                    This took Frank from what he later called the "free air of Ravenscroft" where he could wander as he
                    wished, to his grandparents' home at Pembroke House, where he was closely supervised and confined to
                    the
                    grounds. He found the atmosphere stifling – no subject considered vulgar could be mentioned, and he
                    was
                    required to go to church and have religious education.[9] The earl was by then past 80, two decades
                    older than his wife, and spent many of his waking hours reading: the house was dominated by Lady
                    John,[10] who employed a strict moral code in raising the boys.[11] Frank was not allowed much time
                    alone with Bertrand, as he was believed a bad influence on his younger brother,[12] and Frank
                    Russell
                    wrote of Bertrand, "Till he went to Cambridge he was an unendurable little prig."[13] Annabel Huth
                    Jackson, a friend of both boys, deemed Pembroke House, "an unsuitable place ... for children to be
                    brought up in."[14] George Bernard Shaw, a half-century later, wrote to Frank of his incredulity
                    that
                    the boy had not murdered his Uncle Rollo and burned the place down.[14]

                    Frank was sent to Cheam as a boarder in 1876.[15] He was happier at school than he had been at
                    Pembroke
                    Lodge.[16] In his memoirs he remembered his indignation at being addressed by his father's courtesy
                    title, Viscount Amberley, which was now his as heir apparent to the earldom. He was still at Cheam
                    when
                    in 1878, his grandfather died, making Frank the 2nd Earl Russell.[15]<br><br>
                    Frank then attended Winchester College, from 1879 to 1883. Winchester became his spiritual home,[17]
                    and
                    he expressed his reverence for the school in his autobiography. George Santayana, who would be a
                    long-time friend of Frank Russell, described Winchester as "the only place he loved and the only
                    place
                    he was loved".[18] Frank briefly became pious while at Winchester, going so far as to be confirmed
                    by
                    the Bishop of Winchester in November 1880. The orphaned earl was taken under the wing of his
                    housemaster, the Revd George Richardson, and his wife Sarah. It was Sarah Richardson that Santayana
                    was
                    thinking of in making his statement; she later defended Frank Russell as his marital problems filled
                    the
                    daily papers, and he was devastated by her death in 1909.[19] At Winchester, Frank spent four of his
                    happiest years and acquired many of the friends he would have in adult life. From about the time
                    Frank
                    began at Winchester, Frank and Bertrand began to spend time with their maternal grandmother,
                    Henrietta
                    Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley, whom they came to like greatly as far less priggish than Lady
                    John.[20] Frank came to find Lady Stanley's London residence at 40 Dover Street a refuge from
                    Pembroke
                    House.[21]<br><br>
                    It was at Winchester that he befriended the future poet and critic Lionel Johnson, whom he would
                    describe as "the greatest influence of my life at Winchester".[22] They were friends in Russell's
                    final
                    term at Winchester, and Johnson visited Pembroke House, but the friendship did not truly blossom
                    until
                    Russell went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1883.[23] The pair wrote long, earnest letters to
                    each
                    other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality.[24] In 1919
                    Russell
                    anonymously published Johnson's side of the correspondence as Some Winchester Letters of Lionel
                    Johnson.[25]<br><br>

                    At Balliol, Russell read classics. The scholar of classical Greek literature Benjamin Jowett was
                    then
                    Master of Balliol and also Vice-Chancellor of Oxford. Russell found the university stimulating,
                    welcoming the "untrammelled and unfettered discussions on everything in heaven and earth".[26] He
                    wrote
                    to Johnson at Winchester, and after the correspondence was forbidden by Johnson's father, routed his
                    letters through fellow undergraduate Charles Sayle. Russell joined university clubs and other
                    groups,
                    and made satisfactory academic progress through much of his first two years,[27] but his Oxford
                    career
                    was dramatically cut short when in May 1885, as Russell related it in his memoirs, he was sent down
                    by
                    Jowett for supposedly writing a "scandalous" letter to another male undergraduate. Russell denied
                    the
                    charges but was refused a formal inquiry. Incensed at having been falsely accused, he lost his
                    temper
                    with Jowett, telling him he was no gentleman, and left the college.[28] Even after a year, Jowett
                    refused Russell re-admission to Balliol, and refused the necessary recommendation to allow Russell
                    to
                    enter a Cambridge college.[29]<br><br>
                    The veracity of Russell's account of his sending-down is open to question; Santayana deemed it a
                    fabrication, based on what Russell had privately told him, but at the core of it was the nature of
                    Russell's relationship with Johnson. In April 1885, Johnson, who had recently turned 18 but appeared
                    younger, stayed overnight in Russell's rooms after missing the last train to London, and, according
                    to
                    Santayana, the authorities had seen the two together and declared Johnson too young to be Russell's
                    "natural friend".[30] Nevertheless, Santayana wrote that the relations between Russell and Johnson
                    had
                    not been "in the least erotic or even playful".[31] In July 1885, two months after Russell was sent
                    down, Johnson's father enquired of Jowett whether Russell was a suitable companion for Lionel, and
                    was
                    told he was not, and that further acquaintance between the two should be forbidden. Russell and
                    Jowett
                    reconciled to some extent, and the master was present at the earl's first wedding in 1890. Russell,
                    though, missed Jowett's funeral in 1893, alleging rheumatism, and remained bitter about the end of
                    his
                    Oxford career for the rest of his life.[32] Santayana stated that any "unnatural desires" on
                    Russell's
                    part did not last, given that he turned out "a perfectly normal pronounced polygamous male".[33]

                        He was a tall young man of twenty, still lithe though large of bone, with abundant tawny hair,
                        clear
                        little steel-blue eyes, and a florid complexion. He moved deliberately, gracefully, stealthily,
                        like
                        a tiger well fed and with a broad margin of leisure for choosing his prey. There was precision
                        in
                        his indolence; and mild as he seemed, he suggested a latent capacity to leap, a latent
                        astonishing
                        celerity and strength, that could crush at one blow. Yet his speech was simple and suave,
                        perfectly
                        decided and strangely frank.

                    After his sending-down from Oxford, Russell took a year's leasehold on a small house in the village
                    of
                    Hampton, to which his guardians (he was not yet 21 years old, the age of majority at the time)
                    reluctantly consented on condition a tutor of their choice live with him. Although the monotony of
                    life
                    in the London suburbs was varied by guests such as Oscar Wilde, Russell was resentful at how he had
                    been
                    treated at Oxford and in October 1885, took ship for the United States.[35] He was generally
                    impressed
                    with America, but disliked New York City. On his trip, he first met Santayana, then an undergraduate
                    at
                    Harvard College; he was the first Englishman Santayana had ever met. Russell also met Walt Whitman
                    on
                    his trip across America and back, and visited the president, Grover Cleveland at the White
                    House.[36]<br><br>
                    Russell attained his majority in August 1886, and came into his inheritance, allowing him to live on
                    a
                    grander scale. He was not idle, involving himself with an electrical contracting company, a field he
                    had
                    experimented in since his boyhood. This was the first of many commercial enterprises in which he
                    would
                    participate. Like Russell's commercial career as a whole, it had mixed success, ceasing to trade
                    within
                    three years. An expensive lifestyle and fees from the many court actions he was involved in would
                    lead
                    him to describe himself as bankrupt by 1921, and when Frank died ten years later, Bertrand said he
                    had
                    inherited a title from his brother but little else.[37]<br><br>

                    Although Russell was not wealthy by the standards of British nobility, what he did have, including
                    his
                    title, was enough to make him the target of parents seeking suitable matches for their daughters.
                    Among
                    these were Maria Selina (Lina) Elizabeth, Lady Scott,[b] who sought a suitable match for her
                    daughter,
                    Mabel Edith Scott, and called on Russell in 1889. Santayana recalled that Russell was at first more
                    interested in Selina Scott, a divorcée, than her daughter[39] and theorised that the fact that
                    Russell's
                    mother died when he was a child allowed Lady Scott to overwhelm Russell and persuade him that the
                    way to
                    perpetuate their friendship was for him to marry her daughter.[40]<br><br>
                    Frank and Mabel Russell married on 6 February 1890. Three months later, the two separated, Mabel
                    alleging physical and mental cruelty.[41] Santayana later wrote, "Russell as a husband, Russell in
                    the
                    domestic sphere, was simply impossible: excessively virtuous and incredibly tyrannical. He didn't
                    allow
                    her enough money or enough liberty. He was punctilious and unforgiving about hours, about
                    truth-telling,
                    about debts. He objected to her friends, her clothes, and borrowed jewels. Moreover, in their
                    intimate
                    relations he was exacting and annoying. She soon hated and feared him."[42]<br><br>
                    Late in 1890, Mabel sued unsuccessfully to judicially separate from him, accusing him in the process
                    of
                    "immoral behaviour" with another university friend, Herbert Roberts, head mathematics tutor at Bath
                    College.[41] The allegations of the trial filled the newspapers.[43] and a jury found in Frank
                    Russell's
                    favour.[44] At the time, the only valid ground for divorce was adultery, although a woman alleging
                    it
                    would also have to show some other offence, such as desertion. With the approval of their families,
                    Frank and Mabel Russell continued to live apart, a tacitly agreed relationship that meant Mabel was
                    unlikely to be able to show desertion.[45] Although there were fitful efforts at reconciliation
                    thereafter, the parties remained apart. In 1892, Russell opened his own firm of electrical
                    engineers,
                    Russell & Co. He began to be seen more in the House of Lords, in September 1893 being one of forty
                    peers
                    who supported the unsuccessful Irish Home Rule bill.[46] Despite the lull in the Russell matrimonial
                    litigation, detectives were active for both sides, hoping to find evidence of adultery which would
                    allow
                    their employer advantage in the courts.[47] By 1894, Frank Russell, as he told his brother Bertrand,
                    was
                    three years into an affair with Mary Morris, a clerk at his electrical works.[48]<br><br>
                    Having failed to convince the jury, Mabel subsequently attempted to obtain a separation by indirect
                    means, suing for restitution of conjugal rights in 1894. Under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1884,
                    failure
                    to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights served to establish desertion, which gave
                    the
                    other spouse the right to an immediate decree of judicial separation, and, if coupled with the
                    husband's
                    adultery, allowed the wife to obtain a divorce. Such an action also allowed a petitioning wife to
                    seek
                    an allowance. In general, at the time in England, divorces were available only when the petitioning
                    spouse had not offended against the marriage and the other spouse had.[49] The earl countersued on
                    the
                    ground that her accusations since 1891 amounted to legal cruelty. A jury found for Frank Russell in
                    both
                    cases in 1895, but Mabel appealed and the verdict was overturned in the Court of Appeal. The case
                    went
                    all the way to the House of Lords, and the Law Lords affirmed the appeals court decision.[44] This
                    denied them both satisfaction, binding the definition of legal cruelty to physical violence and
                    making
                    Russell v. Russell a case of legal significance for the next seventy years,[c] until divorce law
                    reform
                    eliminated cruelty as a statutory ground for divorce.[50] Another trial took place in 1897 after
                    Lady
                    Scott published accusations against Russell; she was convicted of criminal libel and sentenced to
                    eight
                    months in prison, but Russell was hissed at by the crowds surrounding the Old Bailey after the
                    sentencing, and called the "Wicked Earl".[51]<br><br>
                    The Local Government Act 1894 created district and parish councils. In December of that year Russell
                    successfully stood for Cookham Parish Council, and was made chairman, and ex officio a guardian of
                    the
                    poor. He worked to change outdated practices in the workhouse, and to see that roads and rights of
                    way
                    were maintained. In February 1895, he was elected to London County Council (LCC) for Newington West
                    as a
                    Progressive. He aligned himself with the left, joining the Reform Club in 1894, a bastion of
                    Liberalism.[52] He stood unsuccessfully for Hammersmith at the next election, in March 1898, but was
                    made an alderman, continuing him on the LCC,[53] where he remained through 1904.[54]

                    secretary of the Hammersmith Women's Liberal Association. She campaigned for Russell; the two became
                    close and were seen together at several events. When she fell ill early in 1899, Russell let her use
                    one
                    of his residences, and the two went away together, travelling via France to America. Russell planned
                    to
                    use laxer American divorce laws to end his marriage to Mabel Russell.[55][56]<br><br>
                    Russell and Mollie Somerville journeyed to Chicago, but learned that local laws had recently been
                    tightened, and required a year's residence, with other restrictive provisions. North Dakota and
                    Arizona
                    Territory were also considered, and in the latter case visited, but also required living there a
                    year.
                    Nevada, with only a six-month requirement, was more practical. They settled in Glenbrook, on the
                    west
                    shore of Lake Tahoe, for the winter of 1899–1900. On 14 April 1900 both Russell and Somerville were
                    granted divorces. Their marriage ceremony in Reno before Judge Benjamin Franklin Curler took place
                    on 15
                    April.[57] They honeymooned on the way to America's East Coast, including at Denver's Brown Palace
                    Hotel, where Russell told a reporter that a charge of bigamy would never stick.[58] The couple
                    returned
                    to Britain the following month.[59]<br><br>
                    Russell knew such a divorce was invalid under English law, which refused to recognise foreign
                    divorces
                    obtained by British subjects; his intent was to allow Mabel Russell to obtain a divorce on the
                    grounds
                    of bigamy following adultery, which would also free him to marry again: he deposited £5,000 that
                    would
                    go to her upon a divorce to ensure her cooperation.[60]<br><br>
                    Beginning when Russell wired news of his Nevada marriage to appear as a notice in The Times, there
                    was
                    considerable press interest on both sides of the Atlantic in what had occurred. Both Mabel Russell
                    and
                    George Somerville filed for divorce, and each gained them uncontested, subject to the usual waiting
                    period before the decrees became absolute. Russell, on his return, took his seat on the LCC as if
                    nothing had occurred. There was, initially, no other official reaction, society accepted them as a
                    married couple, and Mollie appeared on the 1901 census as "Mollie Russell".[61]

                <p class="section-title">Trial before the Lords</p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Russell was arrested on a charge of bigamy as he stepped from a train at Waterloo Station on 17 June
                    1901.[62] Why an action was brought for this rarely prosecuted crime is uncertain.[63] Russell
                    believed
                    that he was prosecuted when, as he related, another nobleman who had acted similarly but was a
                    favourite
                    at Court was not, because he was "an unbeliever and a radical".[64] The Russell family always
                    believed
                    that the earl was prosecuted at the behest of the new king, Edward VII, who had a chequered past and
                    several mistresses while on the throne, to boost his own reputation for morality.[63]<br><br>
                    Russell was bailed, and following a hearing at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 22 June,[65] he was
                    indicted for bigamy by a grand jury and committed for trial.[59] Until the privilege was abolished
                    in
                    1948,[66] peers and peeresses indicted for treason or felony were tried before the House of Lords, a
                    majority vote deciding the matter.[67] Russell could not have waived trial there had he wanted
                    to,[68]
                    and the verdict of the House of Lords could not be appealed.[69] Such trials were rare: Russell's
                    trial
                    was the first since that of Lord Cardigan, who was acquitted on a charge of duelling in 1841, the
                    previous trial having been in 1776, and only one trial, resulting in the acquittal of Lord de
                    Clifford
                    for manslaughter in 1935, followed before the abolition.[70]

                    Russell's trial before the House of Lords took place in the Royal Gallery of the Houses of
                    Parliament on
                    18 July 1901, with some two hundred peers present, including Lord Salisbury, the prime minister, and
                    with Lord Halsbury, the lord chancellor, presiding under the king's commission as lord high steward.
                    Among those present were Mollie Russell, Judge Curler, and the English clergyman who had performed
                    Russell's first marriage. The assembled peers and judges in their robes were deemed "most
                    picturesque"
                    by The New York Times, which described a "magnificent blaze of color" from the robes of the
                    assembled
                    peers and judges.[68][71] All the Lords of Appeal were present to advise the peers on any legal
                    questions that arose, as were eleven other judges.[72] This required the suspension of the courts
                    over
                    which they would have presided that day, and some newspapers questioned the cost of the spectacle,
                    which
                    included the expense of bringing over Curler from Nevada and housing him for two months.[73]<br><br>
                    When Russell's trial began on 18 July, he was called upon to plead guilty or not guilty, but his
                    counsel
                    interposed, and argued that because the wedding had taken place in America, Russell had not violated
                    the
                    bigamy statute. Lord Halsbury dismissed the point without even requiring the prosecution to respond.
                    Russell then pleaded guilty, and made a statement defending his conduct and stating that no one had
                    been
                    injured thereby, and the lords retired to consider their verdict.[71] The House of Lords had the
                    power
                    to disqualify Russell from sitting there in future unless pardoned,[74] but it did not. On the
                    recommendation of Lord Halsbury, Russell was sentenced to three months at Holloway Prison.[75] He
                    wrote
                    in his memoirs that the privilege of peers cost him dearly, as he probably would have been sentenced
                    to
                    a token day in prison at the Old Bailey had he been a commoner. Instead, a great sum of money and
                    considerable effort had been expended to provide him with a trial before the Lords, "and it was
                    necessary that the sentence should bear some relation to the fuss made about it."[76] In
                    anticipation of
                    his arrival, a room for favoured prisoners, previously occupied by the journalist W. T. Stead and by
                    some of the Jameson raiders, had been prepared for him, where he could have his own food and
                    wine.[71]<br><br>
                    Russell spent part of his time in prison peppering the home secretary, Charles Ritchie, with
                    petitions
                    for his early release (which he did not gain) and for better conditions and more privileges (which,
                    mostly, he received). He read through the works of Shakespeare, twice,[77] and wrote his first book,
                    Lay
                    Sermons, treating religious and ethical questions from his perspective as an agnostic. His friend,
                    Santayana, was unimpressed with the book, describing it as "the only regrettable consequence" of
                    Russell's incarceration.[78] He was released on 17 October 1901, eleven days before his divorce by
                    Mabel
                    Russell became absolute (George Somerville's divorce of Mollie had become absolute on 24 June).
                    Frank
                    Russell married Mollie according to English law on 31 October 1901.[79]<br><br>
                    Frank Russell persisted in his view that he had done nothing wrong.[78] In 1911 he approached the
                    prime
                    minister, H. H. Asquith, asking for a free pardon, and when asked why he deserved it, told Asquith,
                    "Well, the official reason is that I have been a good citizen, for ten years since the offence, and
                    that
                    my conduct is free from any reproach; but if you ask me for the real reason I should say because the
                    conviction was a piece of hypocritical tosh."[80] A free pardon was duly issued by the home
                    secretary,
                    Winston Churchill.[78]

                    Released from prison, Russell attempted to use his place in the House of Lords to reform the law of
                    divorce. In 1902 he introduced legislation to allow divorce based on cruelty, lunacy, three years
                    separation, or one year if both parties consented. Their lordships, led by Lord Halsbury,
                    immediately
                    voted down the bill, rather than (as was usual with bills that were not to be passed) postponing
                    consideration of it. Russell tried again in 1903, with an identical outcome. Attempts in 1905 and
                    1908
                    were treated more gently by the Lords, which postponed consideration rather than rejecting them
                    outright.[81] Russell wrote of his proposals in his second book, Divorce (1912), and a royal
                    commission
                    that year recommended reforms, which were in fact slow in coming: it was not until after the First
                    World
                    War that divorce came within reach of those not wealthy, by allowing petitions to be heard at local
                    assizes rather than in London, and no-fault divorce was not enacted until 1969.[82]<br><br>
                    Both because he had become interested in law and because he was in need of income, in 1899, Russell
                    began to read for the law, studies interrupted by his time in Nevada and in Holloway. He was called
                    to
                    the bar in 1905, and practised for about five years.[83]<br><br>
                    Russell was an early motorist and an active member of the RAC (then the Automobile Club of Great
                    Britain
                    and Northern Ireland). He was an outspoken defender of motorists' rights. He is famed for having the
                    registration A 1. This is frequently reported as being the first number plate issued in Britain, but
                    was
                    most likely not – it was, however, the first registration issued by the London County Council (LCC),
                    in
                    1903.[84] Russell was still a member of the LCC, and awarded the registration to himself. The number
                    plate made him a target for the police, and after five speeding tickets and threats to suspend his
                    licence from magistrates, he sold car and plate in 1906. He continued working for motorists' rights
                    as a
                    barrister, taking large numbers of briefs for motoring offences.[85]<br><br>
                    The marriage with Mollie was generally a success in its early years; according to Russell's
                    biographer,
                    Ruth Derham, she "genuinely loved him, understood that he must be master in his own house ... her
                    outside interests provided them both with a degree of independence."[86] High among these was
                    women's
                    suffrage: both spouses spoke at public meetings in favour of votes for women, and Mollie challenged
                    Asquith to provide more than just a "vague promise" of the vote.[87] Russell disapproved of militant
                    suffragists such as Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, but conceded that their tactics were
                    effective.[88]

                    In 1909 Russell met the woman who would become his third wife, the novelist Elizabeth von Arnim (née
                    Mary Annette Beauchamp), widow of Count Henning August von Arnim-Schlagenthin, by whom she had five
                    children. The widowed von Arnim had an affair with H. G. Wells, and ended her relationship with
                    Wells
                    after learning that he had another lover. At the same time, Frank and Mollie Russell had quarrelled
                    and
                    were growing apart, and he and Elizabeth von Arnim moved in the same literary circles. They fell in
                    love
                    in a visit he paid her, without Mollie, over the New Year of 1914.[89] Mollie Russell petitioned for
                    restoration of conjugal rights but once convinced Frank would not return, accepted an allowance for
                    life, which Bertrand continued to pay after Frank's death in 1931, permitting her to live a life of
                    leisure. In exchange, she sued for divorce on the grounds of desertion and adultery, and the suit
                    was
                    not contested.[90]<br><br>
                    Frank and Elizabeth Russell married on 11 February 1916.[91] The marriage failed quickly and
                    acrimoniously, and she fled for America after only six months of marriage, Frank's temper being a
                    major
                    factor. Like each of Frank Russell's marriages, there were no children born of it. It has been
                    suggested
                    that the earl was addicted to cocaine, though Derham found this to be unlikely and contended that
                    the
                    addiction which helped destroy the marriage was Frank's love of gambling at bridge.[92] Two weeks
                    before
                    his death in 1931 Frank Russell wrote to Santayana that he had received two great shocks in his
                    life,
                    when Jowett sent him down from Oxford, and "when Elizabeth left me I went completely dead and have
                    never
                    come alive again."[93] An attempted reconciliation failed in 1919.[91] They never divorced. Von
                    Arnim
                    famously caricatured Russell in her 1921 novel Vera, a depiction that greatly angered him, and when
                    Elizabeth heard of her husband's death in 1931 she said she was "never happier in her
                    life".[94]<br><br>
                    Russell had continued to take liberal stances in the House of Lords, strongly supporting the
                    Parliament
                    Act 1911, which diminished its powers, and in December 1912 joined the Fabian Society, the first
                    peer to
                    do so. Nevertheless, he did not align himself with the fledgling Labour Party, and in January 1913,
                    decried the "dangerous immunity" of trade unions.[95] Russell supported British involvement in the
                    First
                    World War once it started, but sympathised with his brother Bertrand's anti-war views. Both opposed
                    conscription, and Frank was one of only two peers to speak in opposition in the Lords when Asquith
                    brought in conscription in 1916.[95]<br><br>
                    Bertrand's anti-war activities were considerable, despite Frank urging caution on him; he was
                    successfully prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act, banned from areas of the country, sacked
                    from his position as lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, and denied a passport to go to America
                    to
                    take up a position at Harvard.[96] By late 1917, though, Bertrand had become disillusioned with his
                    cause and Frank met with General George Cockerill of the War Office, resulting in agreement within
                    the
                    government on 17 January 1918 that the banning order should be lifted. The same day, though,
                    Bertrand
                    published an article, "The German Peace Offer" in The Tribunal, causing the government to rescind
                    the
                    agreement, and in February he was prosecuted and sentenced to six months in prison, a sentence he
                    began
                    in May after an appeal failed. He was allowed, though, to serve his sentence at Brixton Prison, with
                    greater privileges than the magistrate would have given him. In a 1959 BBC interview Bertrand
                    attributed
                    this to Frank's influence over the home secretary, Sir George Cave, though Bertrand's biographer,
                    Ray
                    Monk, believed that Bertrand was confusing the efforts to get him these privileges with Frank's
                    later
                    efforts to secure a remission,[97] which bore fruit when Bertrand was released six weeks early.[98]
                    While Bertrand was in prison, Frank visited him, and with Bertrand limited to one outgoing letter
                    per
                    week, received lengthy letters from his brother containing messages to be given to other
                    people.[99]

                    Elizabeth's publication of Vera led to threats from Russell's solicitor, but only served to increase
                    interest in the book.[100] Bertrand and Santayana considered the depiction cruel but Santayana
                    admitted
                    it was accurate in detail. The earl carried a copy of it around with him, and attempted to refute
                    individual passages from it to those willing to listen.[101] Russell's more substantial response was
                    to
                    write his memoirs, My Life and Adventures, published in 1923, in which Elizabeth is never mentioned.
                    The
                    book was well received; most reviewers deemed it entertaining.[102]

                    From the early 1920s Russell was more commonly seen in the House of Lords. He fully embraced the
                    Labour
                    Party when it took office for the first time under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924.[103] He was given no
                    office
                    in that short-lived government, possibly because of his past marital problems.[104] By the time
                    Labour
                    was in government again, in 1929, Russell had proved his worth to the Labour Party both in debate –
                    there were then very few Labour peers – and through service in committee and on royal commissions.
                    Russell hoped to be Lord President of the Council or Leader of the House of Lords, but these posts
                    went
                    to Lord Parmoor. Russell was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Herbert
                    Morrison, a post for which his considerable experience with automobiles qualified him.[105]<br><br>
                    Russell's main accomplishment in the Transport position was steering the Road Traffic Act 1930
                    through
                    the House of Lords. This abolished the 20 miles per hour speed limit that had been in place for
                    motor
                    cars since 1893, but also required compulsory insurance and set a minimum driving age, as well as
                    legislating against dangerous driving.[106] Having served on the Royal Commission on Lunacy, Russell
                    introduced what became the Mental Treatment Act 1930, allowing voluntary admission to psychiatric
                    facilities and permitting a local authority to establish mental health outpatient
                    clinics.[107]<br><br>
                    Russell was promoted to Under-Secretary of State for India under William Wedgwood Benn. He began his
                    tenure by stating that Indian independence was "at this moment impossible", something which although
                    quickly retracted, Nehru concluded was the true attitude of the British government. He worked hard
                    to
                    overcome the gaffe, and was a delegate to the First Round Table Conference (1930–1931). As one of
                    Labour's few representatives in the Lords, he was often called upon to steer legislation having
                    nothing
                    to do with his portfolio. In February 1931, he took a holiday on the Riviera, where he suffered from
                    influenza. Still recovering from this, he died at his hotel in Marseilles on 3 March 1931, the day
                    before he was supposed to depart for home. He was cremated there, and his ashes were scattered in
                    the
                    gardens of his former home, Telegraph House.[108]<br><br>
                    The prime minister, MacDonald, stated, "He was one of the most charming men I have ever met and
                    behind
                    his charm of manner was a really very great intelligence. He was a most valuable colleague both in
                    making preparations for the round-table conference and in helping us to study and master the
                    problems
                    involved, and then in making the conference a success."[109] Benn regretted Russell's death "not
                    only
                    because it deprives the India office of a distinguished political figure but because of the personal
                    loss of a brilliant, kindly friend".[109]

                    Russell stated of himself:<br>
                </p>
                <p class="indent">I have always been a fighter from the time when I fought first my Uncle Rollo, then
                    Benjamin Jowett, and
                    then for six awful years Mabel Edith. It is my misfortune and not my fault that practically the
                    whole of
                    my life has been chronicled in detail in the daily Press. Few people can abhor and resent publicity
                    in
                    what has to do with the private life more than I do, and the result, of course, is to give the
                    public a
                    curiously distorted view of one's character and tastes.[110]</p>
                <p>
                    Annabel Jackson remembered Russell as a child as Bertrand's "beautiful and gifted elder
                    brother".[111]
                    Santayana wrote that while Lionel Johnson could be judged by his poems, "poor Russell had only his
                    ruins
                    to display and to be judged by most unjustly, ruins of passions that had hounded him through life
                    like a
                    series of nightmares, and had made the gossips call him 'The Wicked Earl'."[112] To Derham, Russell
                    "was
                    not a evil man. Neither by modern standards was he 'wicked'. Throughout his life, his strong
                    identification with his youthful self, misunderstood, persecuted, and wronged, led him to seek
                    reforms
                    that benefited many an underdog, but also made him 'suspect the satisfied', 'distrust the majority',
                    impatient with acquaintance and unsuccessful in love."[113] Ann Holmes, in her chapter on the
                    Russell
                    divorce cases, stated that in late Victorian England, "marital fidelity was not as important as the
                    appearance of a stable marriage and happy home; scandal was more shameful than adultery. It was a
                    rule
                    painfully learned by the second Earl Russell and his wife ... Russell was a martyr in that he chose
                    to
                    defend himself publicly when he could have addressed his marital problems in private. At the very
                    least,
                    he could have agreed to negotiate a monetary settlement ... He and his family paid a high price for
                    his
                    stubborn refusal to relent."[114]<br><br>
                    The divorce suits between Frank and Mabel Russell had historic significance.[115] Jack Harpster in
                    his
                    article on Russell's Nevada divorce, noted, "John Francis Stanley Russell's personal problems found
                    expression in political activism, specifically in his effort to change England's outdated divorce
                    statutes. Although he saw no progress during his lifetime ..."[116] Gail Savage, in her journal
                    article
                    on Russell's divorce law advocacy, stated, "Frank Russell's vulnerability to the charms of a pretty
                    widow and her pretty daughter had devastating consequences for his personal life. But the trajectory
                    of
                    Frank Russell's personal misfortunes and the impetus of his personality intersected a larger-scale
                    social and cultural dynamic that involved a refiguring of the ways in which we understand gender
                    relations and marriage."[117] The House of Lords' decision in Russell v. Russell remained a leading
                    case
                    in divorce law for decades, establishing several legal precedents.[118] The first celebrity to get a
                    Nevada divorce,[119] Russell's efforts there first drew attention to that state as a place where one
                    could get an easier divorce than at home, though the divorce of Laura and William E. Corey (1906)
                    and
                    the establishment of an office in Nevada (1907) and subsequent promotion of the state by the New
                    York
                    lawyer, William H. Schnitzer, were greater factors in making Nevada a centre for
                    divorces.[83]<br><br>
                    Peter Bartrip concluded his biographical sketch of Russell,<br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    It is hard to warm to Frank but easier to excuse, or at least explain, his character in terms of
                    genetic
                    inheritance, peculiar upbringing and the childhood tragedies that cost him most of his immediate
                    family.
                    The adult who emerged was a mass of contradiction: the socialist aristocrat who was proud of his
                    status
                    yet contemptuous of social convention; the agnostic who wrote sermons; the protector of the
                    oppressed
                    who tyrannized servants; the champion of women's rights who bullied his wives; the opponent of bad
                    driving who briefly made a career of defending bad drivers. In the end he will be remembered less
                    for
                    his achievements and more for his marital history, scandals and association with those family
                    members,
                    notably his grandfather, brother and third wife, whose achievements far outshone his own.[120]

                        financial turbulence" when he came to live with his grandparents.

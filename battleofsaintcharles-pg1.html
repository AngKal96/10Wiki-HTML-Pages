                    The <b>Battle of St. Charles</b> was fought on June 17, 1862, at St. Charles, Arkansas, during the
                    American Civil War. Earlier in 1862, a Union Army force commanded by Major General Samuel R. Curtis
                    moved against Little Rock, Arkansas, but became bogged down in the Batesville area due to lack of
                    supplies. The Union
                    leadership decided to send a naval force from Memphis, Tennessee, up the White River to resupply
                    Curtis's men.
                    Major General Thomas C. Hindman, the Confederate commander in Arkansas, had fortifications
                    constructed
                    near St.
                    Charles to stop the Union movement. Two artillery positions were built, and three ships, including
                    CSS
                    Maurepas, were
                    scuttled to obstruct the river.<br><br>The Union ships advanced against the Confederate positions on
                    June 17. The 46th Indiana Infantry Regiment was sent ashore to attack the fortifications on land,
                    while
                    two ironclads and two timberclads
                    attacked the fort from the river. During the fighting, a Confederate solid shot struck the ironclad
                    USS
                    Mound City,
                    puncturing one of the ship's steam drums. In what has been referred to as the deadliest shot of the
                    war,
                    scalding
                    steam filled the ship, killing or wounding all but about 25 of the roughly 175 men on the vessel.
                    The
                    46th
                    Indiana overran the Confederate defenses on land and the position was taken. The supply mission was
                    unable to
                    make it all the way to Curtis's position, and withdrew back down the river due to low water levels.
                    Thereafter,
                    Curtis's army cut loose from their supply line and marched to Helena, Arkansas. A portion of the
                    battlefield is listed
                    on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Charles Battle Site.

                  <p>
                    After the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States in 1860, several southern
                    states considered seceding from the union. The southern state of Arkansas held a statewide election
                    on February 18, 1861, to create a convention to vote on secession, with anti-secessionist delegates
                    initially holding the majority. Slavery was considered to be a key issue. After convening on March 4
                    (the same day that Lincoln was inaugurated), the convention adjourned on March 21 without reaching a
                    conclusion.[1] The bombardment of Fort Sumter by Confederate troops, forcing the surrender of the
                    United States-held fort in seceded territory on April 12[2] swung political opinion to secession,
                    and the convention reconvened on May 6, voting to secede later that day. Arkansas then joined the
                    Confederate States of America.[1]

                    After significant military activity in Missouri throughout 1861, Major General Earl Van Dorn of the
                    Confederate States Army formed the Army of the West in early March 1862 from forces commanded by
                    Missouri State Guard Major General Sterling Price and Confederate Brigadier General Ben McCulloch.
                    Van Dorn moved his army north towards the Union army of Major General Samuel R. Curtis, but was
                    defeated at the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8.[3] After the defeat, Van Dorn moved his troops
                    east of the Mississippi River, with the movement completed by late April. During the process, Van
                    Dorn essentially stripped Arkansas of its military strength and supplies, and weakened the
                    Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department.[4]

                    Curtis fell back into Missouri after the battle, but then moved his army east to West Plains before
                    turning south. They re-entered Arkansas on April 29 and headed for Batesville.[5] By May 2, the
                    Union soldiers had reached Batesville. A separate column commanded by Brigadier General Frederick
                    Steele reached Jacksonport, which was near Batesville and on the White River, on May 4. Curtis
                    absorbed Steele's men into his force and began to move on the state capital at Little Rock.[6] The
                    movement caused the Confederate government of Arkansas to retire to Hot Springs,[7] and Curtis's men
                    crossed the White River near Batesville.[6] On May 19, a small Union force crossed the Little Red
                    River to forage, but was attacked by Confederate cavalry near Searcy; some of the Union soldiers,
                    including wounded men, were murdered while attempting to surrender.[8] Curtis was informed the next
                    day that his line of supply was at the breaking point, and he decided that further advance without a
                    new supply line was untenable. A small offensive across the Little Red on May 27 was successful,[8]
                    but lack of supplies forced Curtis to withdraw back across both the Little Red and the White, and he
                    sent a message to the Union leadership in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 4, that he would need to
                    continue his retreat if not reinforced.[9]

                    The message was forwarded to Major General Henry W. Halleck, who then directed Flag Officer Charles
                    H. Davis to send a flotilla up the White River to Jacksonport to resupply Curtis, as the roads in
                    that region of Arkansas were too poor for easy resupply by land.[10] Halleck also communicated with
                    United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who in turn passed the communication to Secretary
                    of the Navy Gideon Welles, who sent a telegram to Davis ordering him to move up the White to relieve
                    Curtis. Davis received Welles's telegram on June 12 and began making immediate preparations for the
                    movement. He asked Colonel Charles R. Ellet, commander of the Ram Fleet, to send some of the ram
                    ships to serve with the vessels of Davis's Western Flotilla, but Ellet would agree to this only
                    under the condition that the Ram Fleet and Western Flotilla vessels would be separate commands,
                    which Davis refused.[11] Less than a week before, on June 6, the Ram Fleet, under Ellet's father
                    Charles Ellet Jr., and Davis's flotilla, had defeated a Confederate naval fleet at the First Battle
                    of Memphis and taken the city of Memphis, Tennessee.[12] The furthest north Confederate stronghold
                    on the Mississippi River was now Vicksburg, Mississippi, as positions upriver at Columbus, Kentucky,
                    and Island Number Ten had been taken earlier in the year. Few Confederate gunboats remained on the
                    upper portion of the Mississippi watershed, and they were generally in hiding.[13]

                  <p>
                    On June 13, Davis's detachment left Memphis.[7] It was composed of the ironclads USS Mound City and
                    USS St. Louis, the timberclad USS Lexington, and the tugboat USS Spitfire.[a] The ships were under
                    the command of Commander Augustus Kilty.[15] On June 14, the steamboat White Cloud arrived at
                    Memphis; it was to transport the supplies that would go to Curtis. Davis had also heard that the
                    Confederates had blocked the White with a submerged wooden raft, which would have to be removed.
                    Expecting the riverbanks to be occupied by Confederate soldiers, Colonel Graham Fitch and his 46th
                    Indiana Infantry Regiment were sent on the transport New National to provide infantry support.[16]
                    Fitch's force was almost 1,000 men strong.[17]

                    On the morning of June 15, the timberclad USS Conestoga, New National, White Cloud, and the
                    steamboat Jacob Musselman left Memphis to join Kilty. Meanwhile, Spitfire had escorted a captured
                    Confederate steamboat downriver and was replaced by the tugboat USS Spiteful. The two groups of
                    ships united on June 16.[16] On the same day, Kilty's ships approached St. Charles. The vessels made
                    it within 8 miles (13 km) of the defenses. Two scouting parties were sent forward: one on shore and
                    one on Spiteful. They detected the two Confederate batteries, as well as further infantry and naval
                    components, but were unable to provide exact strengths. Fitch and Kilty decided to attack the next
                    morning.[18]

                    Confederate Major General Thomas C. Hindman had replaced Van Dorn as commander in Arkansas. Working
                    to build up the remnants left by Van Dorn's departure, Hindman declared martial law, authorized
                    guerrilla warfare, and formed the base of an army.[19] After Curtis's expedition bogged down,
                    Hindman anticipated a Union naval movement up either the White or the Arkansas River. He sent out a
                    surveying expedition on June 3 to investigate the possibility of blocking the rivers. When the level
                    of the Arkansas River fell, the Confederates focused on the White. A site near St. Charles was
                    selected as a favorable location for the emplacement of a battery on the bluffs and an obstruction
                    in the river. Captain A. M. Williams and 100 soldiers were sent to construct the emplacements. Logs
                    were floated downriver and driven into the river bottom as an obstruction, and batteries were
                    constructed on the bluffs.[20][21] Two rifled 32-pounder guns were taken from the gunboat CSS
                    Pontchartrain and mounted in the main battery on June 8,[22] while two 3-inch Parrott rifles were
                    sent from Little Rock and placed in a smaller position 400 yards (370 m) away.[20][21]
                    Pontchartrain's guns were placed on a commanding position on a bluff 75 feet (23 m) above a bend in
                    the river. While they had an excellent field of fire, they were also masked by trees and brush.[22]
                    The gunboat CSS Maurepas arrived at St. Charles on June 14. Two days later, Hindman was informed of
                    Kilty's movement. With the obstruction incomplete and no other troops available to reinforce the St.
                    Charles position, 35 sailors and naval officers from Pontchartrain, including Lieutenant John W.
                    Dunnington, the vessel's commander, volunteered and were sent down to help man the defenses. They
                    arrived at 18:00 that day.[20]

                    On the night of June 16/17, Williams informed Hindman that the Union force had reached the area, and
                    that the obstruction still was not complete. Hindman ordered two civilian steamboats at St. Charles
                    scuttled to block the river.[23] The commander of Maurepas, Captain Joseph Fry, also had his ship,
                    which would have been mismatched against the Union ironclads, scuttled, although a 12-pounder
                    howitzer, a rifled cannon made of brass,[23][24][25] and a third artillery piece were removed
                    first.[26] The lower battery of 3-inch rifles was strengthened with the brass piece from Maurepas
                    and 34 of Williams's men of the 29th Arkansas Infantry Regiment.[21][24] The other members of the
                    Arkansas regiment did not have weapons and were sent back to Little Rock.[21][26] The Confederate
                    sailors were largely armed with single-shot pistols, which would be of dubious value in a land
                    battle.[21] Overall, the Confederates had seven cannons and 114 men at St. Charles.[26]

                  Before daybreak on June 17, the Confederates made dispositions to defend against the attack.
                  Dunnington and his men were in the upper battery manning the two 32-pounders, while men from Maurepas
                  manned the lower position, which contained three guns. The infantrymen were sent downstream under
                  Williams to serve as sharpshooters, and were supported by the 12-pounder howitzer taken off of
                  Maurepas. Fry was in overall command.[27] Around 06:00, Kilty's ships began moving upriver again.
                  Mound City led the approach, with St. Louis, Lexington, and Conestoga following; the other vessels
                  were not armed and were in the rear. Within 2.5 miles (4.0 km) of St. Charles, Confederates were
                  sighted on the river bank. Mound City opened fire and scattered them, after which the Indiana infantry
                  disembarked from Jacob Musselman and New National.[28] Sources disagree as to when the firing began.
                  Historian Ed Bearss states that the firing started at 07:36,[28] while historian Mark Hubbs provides
                  09:00,[22] and Dunnington stated that the fighting began at around 08:30.[29] Conestoga and Lexington
                  began contributing fire later. Once Fitch's men were ashore, two companies were thrown out as a
                  skirmish line, and the men began advancing towards the Confederate defenses. It was planned for
                  Fitch's men on shore and the ships in the river to move at about the same rate.[28]

                  Mound City kept steaming forward, and the lower Confederate battery opened fire when the ship was
                  almost upon it, without effect. Kilty was unsure of the exact locations of the Confederate batteries,
                  and had the two timberclads hold back while the ironclads moved forward. For fifteen minutes the two
                  ships dueled with the lower battery, before Mound City moved ahead. And she neared point-blank range
                  of Dunnington's battery, the Confederates opened fire, but at first were unable to damage the Union
                  vessel.[30] Meanwhile, Fitch's men had advanced and were about to attack the lower Confederate
                  position[21] when a solid shot,[31] the third fired from Dunnington's position,[22] struck Mound City
                  at 10:03. The shot hit the ironclad's casemate near a gun

                    three[32] or four sailors outright.[21] The shot then punctured one of the ship's poorly protected
                    steam drums,[24] which connected to the ship's engines and fed them pressurized steam.[33] Steam
                    filled the ship, scalding many of the ship's men. Many of those not near escape points were
                    killed.[21] Of the roughly 175 men onboard Mound City, 105[24] or 125 were killed and a further

                    shot of the war.[24]

                    With steam pouring out of her and badly scalded men visible on the decks, Mound City drifted
                    downstream and ran into the riverbank near the lower battery. Fry demanded that the remaining Union
                    sailors aboard surrender, and when this was refused, ordered his men to fire on Union sailors in the
                    river trying to swim to safety.[35] Several of the wounded men were killed when the Confederates
                    opened fire.[21] With Mound City out of the fight, St. Louis and Dunnington's guns began dueling,
                    until Fitch signaled for the ships to cease fire.[36] The Union infantrymen were about to storm the
                    Confederate fortifications, and Fitch wanted to prevent accidental friendly fire.[17] Scaling the
                    bluffs, Fitch's men moved into a position from which to outflank the Confederate defenses. Williams
                    attempted to have some of his men occupy Charles Belknap's house as a defensive position, but the
                    Union men beat them to the position. After learning of this, Fry had them

                    guns in the lower battery spiked and the position abandoned.[37] Spiking the cannons involved
                    driving a metal spike into the touch hole of the cannon to temporarily prevent it being capable of
                    firing.[38] After a short skirmish, it became clear that the Confederates would be captured if they
                    did not retreat.[24]<br><br>Fry ordered Dunnington to cover the retreat with his men, but Dunnington
                    refused, noting that some of his men were unarmed and those who were had only single-shot pistols
                    which had already been emptied at Mound City's survivors,[39] with no time to reload.[21] A final
                    cannon shot was fired at St. Louis, and the Confederates then scattered with Union troops within 50
                    yards (46 m).[39] During the retreat, Fry was wounded and captured while trying to reach the Belknap
                    house.[21] In addition to Fry, 29 others were captured, although six of them were prisoners Fry had
                    been holding on suspicion of treason. After taking the Confederate fortifications, Fitch signaled
                    the ships. Lexington and St. Louis advanced up to where the sunken ships blocked the river, while
                    Conestoga and Spiteful towed Mound City downstream.[40] Union soldiers were sent into St. Charles to
                    patrol the town, and the local civilians were warned that it would be razed if guerrilla activity
                    occurred. As punishment for the firing on Mound City's wounded, 20 of the Confederate prisoners were
                    placed under arrest,[21] including Fry.[41] The battle was over in under four hours.[25]

                    Kilty was among those scalded on Mound City, and his wounds resulted in the loss of an arm.
                    Lieutenant Wilson McGunnegle, commander of St. Louis, replaced him as expedition commander. The
                    highest-ranking unhurt officer of Mound City had been unnerved by the events and was replaced by an
                    officer from Conestoga. The 58- or 59-man replacement crew for Mound City was drawn from the 46th
                    Indiana.[21][42] Either 58[43] or 59[21] Union dead were buried in a mass grave at the lower
                    battery,[43] while eight Confederates were buried in St. Charles.[21] Hindman claimed losses of six
                    dead and one wounded.[24] The Civil War Battlefield Guide estimates that the Union had about 160
                    casualties and that the Confederates lost 40.[44] No serious casualties were suffered by the 46th
                    Indiana during its capture of the batteries.[22] The historian Mark K. Christ provides Confederate
                    losses as eight killed and 24 wounded. Historian Mark Hubbs suggests that seven percent of all Union
                    Navy battle deaths in the entire war were the result of the single catastrophic shot that struck
                    Mound City.[45] The Union wounded were sent back down to Memphis on Conestoga. Six Confederate
                    cannons had been captured on the field.[46] Four were sent to Memphis, and the two 32-pounders were
                    spiked and dumped into the river. The Union troops destroyed the Confederate fortifications after
                    the battle.[22]

                    Hindman had sent the 10th Texas Infantry Regiment to reinforce St. Charles, but the unit had to
                    delay to be issued ammunition. By the time this was done, it was June 17. After learning of the fall
                    of St. Charles, the Texans withdrew to DeValls Bluff, where they were reinforced by another
                    regiment, a battalion, and three artillery batteries.[47] Establishing a supply point at St.
                    Charles,[24] McGunnegle's fleet moved past the river obstructions and continued up the White.[21]
                    The movement began on June 18, although Mound City was left behind.[48] The damaged ironclad later
                    returned to service and survived the war.[49] After meeting sporadic Confederate resistance on June
                    19, the vessels reached Clarendon, Arkansas,[50] where they halted due to low water. Fitch took his
                    men ashore and advanced 5 miles (8.0 km) but withdrew after losing 55 men in a fight with
                    Confederate dismounted cavalry.[21] After leaving Clarendon, McGunnegle's flotilla continued north,
                    where they halted for the night at a point in Monroe County known as Crooked Point Cutoff.[24][51]

                    At Crooked Point Cutoff, McGunnegle was informed by his pilots that falling river levels would
                    likely strand the ships if they continued further north, so the decision was made to turn around.
                    Fitch was opposed to falling back without resupplying Curtis, but the ships turned back on the
                    morning of June 20.[52] By June 25, they had returned to the mouth of the river. On June 23, Major
                    General Ulysses S. Grant had taken command of Union forces in Memphis. After receiving communication
                    from Halleck that he still wanted Curtis reinforced, Grant sent additional supply vessels and
                    transports loaded with the 34th and 43rd Indiana Infantry Regiments to join the White River flotilla
                    on June 26.[53] The new vessels reached the others on June 27, and Lexington, Conestoga, and
                    Spiteful escorted the transports and supply ships upriver, leaving on June 28 under the command of
                    Lieutenant James Shirk.[54] At noon on June 30, Shirk's vessels reached Clarendon. With water levels
                    falling, Shirk would not venture beyond the town. Fitch wanted to continue, but learned of a new
                    Confederate strongpoint at DeValls Bluff, and decided that the infantry could not take the position
                    without the gunboats.[55] The Union ships turned back down the river on July 3, but began heading
                    back upriver again on July 5.[56] Union forces reoccupied Clarendon on July 7.[57]

                    Curtis learned that the vessels would not be able to reach his position, so he severed his line of
                    supply and had his men march down the White for two weeks. This was the first time in the war that a
                    Union army had campaigned without a direct line of supply;[31] this would not occur again until the
                    Vicksburg campaign the next year.[58] Curtis emancipated slaves during this movement, and foraging
                    and plundering by his soldiers economically devastated the line of the march.[31][58] In one county
                    alone, $1,500,000 of property damage was inflicted.[21] The Confederates made only one serious
                    attempt to halt Curtis's movement. On July 7, Brigadier General Albert Rust led Confederate cavalry
                    in an assault on

                    the Union force while it was crossing the Cache River. In the ensuing Battle of
                    Cotton Plant, Rust's attack was repulsed, and his men were then routed by a Union counterattack.[59]
                    McGunnegle's vessels had stayed at Clarendon until July 8, and Curtis's men did not reach there
                    until July 9. Having missed his supply rendezvous, Curtis had his troops leave the White and march
                    to the Mississippi River town of Helena, which was reached on July 12.[60] The relief column itself
                    turned up at Helena on July 15.[61] Helena was later used as a significant operating hub for the
                    Union Army in the Vicksburg campaign; the Confederates never retook the city.[45]

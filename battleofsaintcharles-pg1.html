                    The <b>Battle of St. Charles</b> was fought on June 17, 1862, at St. Charles, Arkansas, during the
                    American Civil War. Earlier in 1862, a Union Army force commanded by Major General Samuel R. Curtis
                    moved against Little Rock, Arkansas, but became bogged down in the Batesville area due to lack of
                    supplies. The Union
                    leadership decided to send a naval force from Memphis, Tennessee, up the White River to resupply
                    Curtis's men.
                    Major General Thomas C. Hindman, the Confederate commander in Arkansas, had fortifications
                    constructed
                    near St.
                    Charles to stop the Union movement. Two artillery positions were built, and three ships, including
                    CSS
                    Maurepas, were
                    scuttled to obstruct the river.<br><br>The Union ships advanced against the Confederate positions on
                    June 17. The 46th Indiana Infantry Regiment was sent ashore to attack the fortifications on land,
                    while
                    two ironclads and two timberclads
                    attacked the fort from the river. During the fighting, a Confederate solid shot struck the ironclad
                    USS
                    Mound City,
                    puncturing one of the ship's steam drums. In what has been referred to as the deadliest shot of the
                    war,
                    scalding
                    steam filled the ship, killing or wounding all but about 25 of the roughly 175 men on the vessel.
                    The
                    46th
                    Indiana overran the Confederate defenses on land and the position was taken. The supply mission was
                    unable to
                    make it all the way to Curtis's position, and withdrew back down the river due to low water levels.
                    Thereafter,
                    Curtis's army cut loose from their supply line and marched to Helena, Arkansas. A portion of the
                    battlefield is listed
                    on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Charles Battle Site.

                <h2 class="title">Background</h2>
                <h4>Early activity in Arkansas</h4>
                <p>
                    After the election of Abraham Lincoln as
                    President of the United States in
                    1860, several southern states
                    considered seceding from the union. The southern state of Arkansas held a statewide election on
                    February
                    18, 1861, to create a convention to vote on secession, with anti-secessionist delegates initially
                    holding the majority. Slavery was considered to be a key issue. After convening on March 4 (the same
                    day
                    that Lincoln was inaugurated), the convention adjourned on March 21 without reaching a
                    conclusion.[1]
                    The bombardment of Fort Sumter by Confederate troops forcing the surrender of the United States-held
                    fort in seceded territory on April 12[2] swung political opinion to secession, and the convention
                    reconvened on May 6, voting to secede later that day. Arkansas then joined the Confederate States of
                    America.[1]<br><br>After significant military activity in Missouri throughout 1861, Major General
                    Earl
                    Van Dorn of the
                    Confederate States Army formed the Army of the West in early March 1862 from forces commanded by
                    Missouri State Guard Major General Sterling Price and Confederate Brigadier General Ben McCulloch.
                    Van
                    Dorn moved his army north towards the Union army of Major General Samuel R. Curtis, but was defeated
                    at
                    the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8.[3] After the defeat, Van Dorn moved his troops east of the
                    Mississippi River, with the movement completed by late April. During the process, Van Dorn
                    essentially
                    stripped Arkansas of its military strength and supplies, and weakened the Confederate
                    Trans-Mississippi
                    Department.[4]<br><br>Curtis fell back into Missouri after the battle, but then moved his army east
                    to
                    West Plains before
                    turning south. They re-entered Arkansas on April 29 and headed for Batesville.[5] By May 2, the
                    Union
                    soldiers had reached Batesville. A separate column commanded by Brigadier General Frederick Steele
                    reached Jacksonport, which was near Batesville and on the White River, on May 4. Curtis absorbed
                    Steele's men into his force and began to move on the state capital at Little Rock.[6] The movement
                    caused the Confederate government of Arkansas to retire to Hot Springs,[7] and Curtis's men crossed
                    the
                    White River near Batesville.[6] On May 19, a small Union force crossed the Little Red River to
                    forage,
                    but was attacked by Confederate cavalry near Searcy; some of the Union soldiers, including wounded
                    men,
                    were murdered while attempting to surrender.[8] Curtis was informed the next day that his line of
                    supply
                    was at the breaking point, and he decided that further advance without a new supply line was
                    untenable.
                    A small offensive across the Little Red on May 27 was successful,[8] but lack of supplies forced
                    Curtis
                    to withdraw back across both the Little Red and the White, and he sent a message to the Union
                    leadership
                    in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 4, that he would need to continue his retreat if not
                    reinforced.[9]<br><br>The message was forwarded to Major General Henry W. Halleck, who then directed
                    Flag Officer Charles H. Davis to send a flotilla up the White River to Jacksonport to resupply
                    Curtis,
                    as the roads in that region of Arkansas were too poor for easy resupply by land.[10] Halleck also
                    communicated with United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who in turn passed the
                    communication
                    to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, who sent a telegram to Davis ordering him to move up the
                    White
                    to relieve Curtis. Davis received Welles's telegram on June 12 and began making immediate
                    preparations
                    for the movement. He asked Colonel Charles R. Ellet, commander of the Ram Fleet, to send some of the
                    ram
                    ships to serve with the vessels of Davis's Western Flotilla, but Ellet would agree to this only
                    under
                    the condition that the Ram Fleet and Western Flotilla vessels would be separate commands, which
                    Davis
                    refused.[11] Less than a week before, on June 6, the Ram Fleet, under Ellet's father Charles Ellet
                    Jr.,
                    and Davis's flotilla, had defeated a Confederate naval fleet at the First Battle of Memphis and
                    taken
                    the city of Memphis, Tennessee.[12] The furthest north Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi
                    River
                    was now Vicksburg, Mississippi, as positions upriver at Columbus, Kentucky, and Island Number Ten
                    had
                    been taken earlier in the year. Few Confederate gunboats remained on the upper portion of the
                    Mississippi watershed, and they were generally in hiding.[13]

                <h4>Early activity in Arkansas</h4>
                <p>
                    After the election of Abraham Lincoln as
                    President of the United States in
                    1860, several southern states
                    considered seceding from the union. The southern state of Arkansas held a statewide election on
                    February
                    18, 1861, to create a convention to vote on secession, with anti-secessionist delegates initially
                    holding the majority. Slavery was considered to be a key issue. After convening on March 4 (the same
                    day
                    that Lincoln was inaugurated), the convention adjourned on March 21 without reaching a
                    conclusion.[1]
                    The bombardment of Fort Sumter by Confederate troops forcing the surrender of the United States-held
                    fort in seceded territory on April 12[2] swung political opinion to secession, and the convention
                    reconvened on May 6, voting to secede later that day. Arkansas then joined the Confederate States of
                    America.[1]<br><br>

                <p>After significant military activity in Missouri throughout 1861, Major General EarlVan Dorn of the
                    Confederate States Army formed the Army of the West in early March 1862 from forces commanded by
                    Missouri State Guard Major General Sterling Price and Confederate Brigadier General Ben McCulloch.
                    Van
                    Dorn moved his army north towards the Union army of Major General Samuel R. Curtis, but was defeated
                    at
                    the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8.[3] After the defeat, Van Dorn moved his troops east of the
                    Mississippi River, with the movement completed by late April. During the process, Van Dorn
                    essentially
                    stripped Arkansas of its military strength and supplies, and weakened the Confederate
                    Trans-Mississippi
                    Department.[4]<br><br>Curtis fell back into Missouri after the battle, but then moved his army east
                    to
                    West Plains before
                    turning south. They re-entered Arkansas on April 29 and headed for Batesville.[5] By May 2, the
                    Union
                    soldiers had reached Batesville. A separate column commanded by Brigadier General Frederick Steele
                    reached Jacksonport, which was near Batesville and on the White River, on May 4. Curtis absorbed
                    Steele's men into his force and began to move on the state capital at Little Rock.[6] The movement
                    caused the Confederate government of Arkansas to retire to Hot Springs,[7] and Curtis's men crossed
                    the
                    White River near Batesville.[6] On May 19, a small Union force crossed the Little Red River to
                    forage,
                    but was attacked by Confederate cavalry near Searcy; some of the Union soldiers, including wounded
                    men,
                    were murdered while attempting to surrender.[8] Curtis was informed the next day that his line of
                    supply
                    was at the breaking point, and he decided that further advance without a new supply line was
                    untenable.
                    A small offensive across the Little Red on May 27 was successful,[8] but lack of supplies forced
                    Curtis
                    to withdraw back across both the Little Red and the White, and he sent a message to the Union
                    leadership
                    in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 4, that he would need to continue his retreat if not
                    reinforced.[9]<br><br>The message was forwarded to Major General Henry W. Halleck, who then directed
                    Flag Officer Charles H. Davis to send a flotilla up the White River to Jacksonport to resupply
                    Curtis,
                    as the roads in that region of Arkansas were too poor for easy resupply by land.[10] Halleck also
                    communicated with United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who in turn passed the
                    communication
                    to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, who sent a telegram to Davis ordering him to move up the
                    White
                    to relieve Curtis. Davis received Welles's telegram on June 12 and began making immediate
                    preparations
                    for the movement. He asked Colonel Charles R. Ellet, commander of the Ram Fleet, to send some of the
                    ram
                    ships to serve with the vessels of Davis's Western Flotilla, but Ellet would agree to this only
                    under
                    the condition that the Ram Fleet and Western Flotilla vessels would be separate commands, which
                    Davis
                    refused.[11] Less than a week before, on June 6, the Ram Fleet, under Ellet's father Charles Ellet
                    Jr.,
                    and Davis's flotilla, had defeated a Confederate naval fleet at the First Battle of Memphis and
                    taken
                    the city of Memphis, Tennessee.[12] The furthest north Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi
                    River
                    was now Vicksburg, Mississippi, as positions upriver at Columbus, Kentucky, and Island Number Ten
                    had
                    been taken earlier in the year. Few Confederate gunboats remained on the upper portion of the
                    Mississippi watershed, and they were generally in hiding.[13]

                    With steam pouring out of her and badly scalded men visible on the decks, Mound City
                    drifted downstream and ran into the riverbank near the lower battery. Fry demanded that the
                    remaining
                    Union sailors aboard surrender, and when this was refused, ordered his men to fire on Union sailors
                    in
                    the river trying to swim to safety.[35] Several of the wounded men were killed when the Confederates
                    opened fire.[21] With Mound City out of the fight, St. Louis and Dunnington's guns began dueling,
                    until
                    Fitch signaled for the ships to cease fire.[36] The Union infantrymen were about to storm the
                    Confederate fortifications, and Fitch wanted to prevent accidental friendly fire.[17] Scaling the
                    bluffs, Fitch's men moved into a position from which to outflank the Confederate defenses. Williams
                    attempted to have some of his men occupy Charles Belknap's house as a defensive position, but the
                    Union
                    men beat them to the position. After learning of this, Fry had the guns in the lower battery spiked
                    and
                    the position abandoned.[37] Spiking the cannons involved driving a metal spike into the touch hole
                    of
                    the cannon to temporarily prevent it being capable of firing.[38] After a short skirmish, it became
                    clear that the Confederates would be captured if they did not retreat.[24]<br><br>
                    Fry ordered Dunnington to cover the retreat with his men, but Dunnington refused, noting that some
                    of
                    his men were unarmed and those who were had only single-shot pistols which had already been emptied
                    at
                    Mound City's survivors,[39] with no time to reload.[21] A final cannon shot was fired at St. Louis,
                    and
                    the Confederates then scattered with Union troops within 50 yards (46 m).[39] During the retreat,
                    Fry
                    was wounded and captured while trying to reach the Belknap house.[21] In addition to Fry, 29 others
                    were
                    captured, although six of them were prisoners Fry had been holding on suspicion of treason. After
                    taking
                    the Confederate fortifications, Fitch signaled the ships. Lexington and St. Louis advanced up to
                    where
                    the sunken ships blocked the river, while Conestoga and Spiteful towed Mound City downstream.[40]
                    Union
                    soldiers were sent into St. Charles to patrol the town, and the local civilians were warned that it
                    would be razed if guerrilla activity occurred. As punishment for the firing on Mound City's wounded,
                    20
                    of the Confederate prisoners were placed under arrest,[21] including Fry.[41] The battle was over in
                    under four hours.[25]

                Kilty was among those scalded on Mound City, and his wounds resulted in the loss of an arm.
                Lieutenant
                Wilson McGunnegle, commander of St. Louis, replaced him as expedition commander. The highest-ranking
                unhurt officer of Mound City had been unnerved by the events and was replaced by an officer from
                Conestoga. The 58- or 59-man replacement crew for Mound City was drawn from the 46th
                Indiana.[21][42]
                Either 58[43] or 59[21] Union dead were buried in a mass grave at the lower battery,[43] while eight
                Confederates were buried in St. Charles.[21] Hindman claimed losses of six dead and one wounded.[24]
                The
                Civil War Battlefield Guide estimates that the Union had about 160 casualties and that the
                Confederates
                lost 40.[44] No serious casualties were suffered by the 46th Indiana during its capture of the
                batteries.[22] The historian Mark K. Christ provides Confederate losses as eight killed and 24
                wounded.
                Historian Mark Hubbs suggests that seven percent of all Union Navy battle deaths in the entire war
                were
                the result of the single catastrophic shot that struck Mound City.[45] The Union wounded were sent
                back
                down to Memphis on Conestoga. Six Confederate cannons had been captured on the field.[46] Four were
                sent
                to Memphis, and the two 32-pounders were spiked and dumped into the river. The Union troops
                destroyed
                the Confederate fortifications after the battle.[22]

            Hindman had sent the 10th Texas Infantry Regiment to reinforce St. Charles, but the unit had to
            delay to
            be issued ammunition. By the time this was done, it was June 17. After learning of the fall of St.
            Charles, the Texans withdrew to DeValls Bluff, where they were reinforced by another regiment, a
            battalion, and three artillery batteries.[47] Establishing a supply point at St. Charles,[24]
            McGunnegle's fleet moved past the river obstructions and continued up the White.[21] The movement
            began
            on June 18, although Mound City was left behind.[48] The damaged ironclad later returned to service
            and
            survived the war.[49] After meeting sporadic Confederate resistance on June 19, the vessels reached
            Clarendon, Arkansas,[50] where they halted due to low water. Fitch took his men ashore and advanced
            5
            miles (8.0 km) but withdrew after losing 55 men in a fight with Confederate dismounted cavalry.[21]
            After leaving Clarendon, McGunnegle's flotilla continued north, where they halted for the night at a
            point in Monroe County known as Crooked Point Cutoff.[24][51]

                At Crooked Point Cutoff, McGunnegle was informed by his pilots that falling river levels would likely
                strand the ships if they continued
                further north, so the decision was made to turn around. Fitch was opposed to falling back without
                resupplying Curtis, but the ships turned back on the morning of June 20.[52] By June 25, they had
                returned to the mouth of the river. On June 23, Major General Ulysses S. Grant had taken command of
                Union forces in Memphis. After receiving communication from Halleck that he still wanted Curtis
                reinforced, Grant sent additional supply vessels and transports loaded with the 34th and 43rd Indiana
                Infantry Regiments to join the White River flotilla on June 26.[53] The new vessels reached the others
                on June 27, and Lexington, Conestoga, and Spiteful escorted the transports and supply ships upriver,
                leaving on June 28 under the command of Lieutenant James Shirk.[54] At noon on June 30, Shirk's vessels
                reached Clarendon. With water levels falling, Shirk would not venture beyond the town. Fitch wanted to
                continue, but learned of a new Confederate strongpoint at DeValls Bluff, and decided that the infantry
                could not take the position without the gunboats.[55] The Union ships turned back down the river on July
                3, but began heading back upriver again on July 5.[56] Union forces reoccupied Clarendon on July
                7.[57]<br><br>
                Curtis learned that the vessels would not be able to reach his position, so he severed his line of
                supply and had his men march down the White for two weeks. This was the first time in the war that a
                Union army had campaigned without a direct line of supply;[31] this would not occur again until the
                Vicksburg campaign the next year.[58] Curtis emancipated slaves during this movement, and foraging and
                plundering by his soldiers economically devastated the line of the march.[31][58] In one county alone,
                $1,500,000 of property damage was inflicted.[21] The Confederates made only one serious attempt to halt
                Curtis's movement. On July 7, Brigadier General Albert Rust led Confederate cavalry in an assault on the
                Union force while it was crossing the Cache River. In the ensuing Battle of Cotton Plant, Rust's attack
                was repulsed, and his men were then routed by a Union counterattack.[59] McGunnegle's vessels had stayed
                at Clarendon until July 8, and Curtis's men did not reach there until July 9. Having missed his supply
                rendezvous, Curtis had his troops leave the White and march to the Mississippi River town of Helena,
                which was reached on July 12.[60] The relief column itself turned up at Helena on July 15.[61] Helena
                was later used as a significant operating hub for the Union Army in the Vicksburg campaign; the
                Confederates never retook the city.[45]

                <i>Main article: St. Charles Battle Site</i><br><br>A portion of the battlefield is listed on the
                National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as the St. Charles Battle Site. Divers recovered two
                cannons
                from the river bottom in the 1930s and the Belknap house burned in 1962.[25] Also on the NRHP is the
                St.
                Charles Battle Monument, a commemorative marker placed in 1919. Unusually for a monument in the
                South,
                it commemorates both sides of the battle.[62]
